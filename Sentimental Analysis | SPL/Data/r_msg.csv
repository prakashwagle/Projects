Attached is the SOW for the project I mentioned to you. I am looking for you to fill in the role of the Sr Architect. This is a 10 week engagement starting next Monday. The first two weeks are the preparatory times. I have been on the ground since last week. You would be expected to start work next week.



Please let me know if this works for you. If this works for you, I will talk to Sam (he is on vacation and will be back on Tuesday) and let you know if you need to pack your bags. Hopefully all will work out and I will finally be able to meet you in person.

Hi Scott,

I checked with many associates at offshore and nobody has access to this Troom.

Can you please send the documents as an attachment?

Can you get to the DataTech t-rooms?  RTI has some good docs.  Let me know if you cannot and I will send.  Look under technical delivery assessment.

Hi Scott,

How are you doing? Connecting with you after a long time!

I needed a small help.

Couple of months back I had asked you for a reference document for 'data mart consolidation' work that your team had done. Documents sent by you helped a lot.

I need similar reference. We might be doing an evaluation of 'existing architecture of legacy DataTech' and developing a roadmap for integrating it into DataTech architecture. Though this study is not yet finalized, we want to be prepared for it. I have templates for such kind of study, but wanted to get some more samples.

Do you have any examples of documents related to:

1. 'As is' evaluation of architecture - any deliverables, working documents, checklists, PPTs etc
2. 'envisioned architecture' - any deliverables, working documents, checklists, PPTs etc

Attached are some documents for the project.



1. SOW
2. Project plan as defined by GoldBank
3. Interview list
4. Presentation which the sponsor has given us.
5. Interview questionnaire which I have made for the stake holders
6. Kick-off meeting agenda which I have made


I need you to do the following:

Top Priority: Cross check the SOW weekly deliverables against the project plan and see if they have added stuff which is out of scope. Also, it there is any ambiguity, please highlight it for me. Second activity: Cross check the interview questionnaire against the expectations which the client has layer out in the Stakeholders document and identify if there is a gap.



I will be discussing this with the client tomorrow morning and any feedback from you will be greatly appreciated.

One final thing (every document you send, tempts me to ask for more!)  if you have any questionnaire that was used for client user / IT interviews, can you please share it?



Thanks,

Hi Scott,



I checked with many associates at offshore and nobody has access to this Troom.



Can you please send the documents as an attachment?



Thanks for all your support...

Can you get to the DataTech t-rooms?  RTI has some good docs.  Let me know if you cannot and I will send.  Look under technical delivery assessment.

Hi Scott,



How are you doing? Connecting with you after a long time!



I needed a small help.



Couple of months back I had asked you for a reference document for 'data mart consolidation' work that your team had done. Documents sent by you helped a lot.



I need similar reference. We might be doing an evaluation of 'existing architecture of legacy DataTech' and developing a roadmap for integrating it into DataTech architecture. Though this study is not yet finalized, we want to be prepared for it. I have templates for such kind of study, but wanted to get some more samples.



Do you have any examples of documents related to:



1. 'As is' evaluation of architecture - any deliverables, working documents, checklists, PPTs etc

2. 'envisioned architecture' - any deliverables, working documents, checklists, PPTs etc



Thanks,

Team,

I have an interesting task for which I need volunteers.

We are creating 'BI roadmap for credit risk' for GoldBank. There are 2 influential groups in client: one which favours SAS for standard reporting and one which favours Microstrategy for standard reporting and dashboarding.

My initial reaction is Microstrategy should be a a good choice. But to prove this, we need sound evidence.

Couple of years back we had done similar exercise for ACIC. In that case SAS was ranked much below Microstrategy. Enclosed is documentation for ACIC comparison.

What we need now is:

1. Take out comparison of SAS V/S Microstrategy from enclosed docs.

2. Some of the things must have changed (e.g.SAS has improved in standard reporting a lot in last couple of years). So validate which are still true.

3. Create a 8-10 slide PPT about SAS V/S Microstrategy for standard reporting. This PPT must be full with examples.

This is probably 12-16 hours of work and if 3-4 people work on it, it can be done in a day.

Let me know if anybody wants to volunteer.

Thanks,

kishor Deshpande

Hope you are doing well.



Attached is the draft version of the deck which we can use for the kick-off meeting.



In addition to the presentation which would last about 20 minutes. The other items are:

1. Presentation of the DataTech Reporting Framework and examples (20 minutes)
2. We would like to follow it up with a live demo of how this framework translates into business value. (20 minutes)


We can keep the meeting for 90 minutes so that if there are questions we can extend the discussions to accommodate folks.



In our meeting on Wednesday, we can fine tune this based on your inputs.



In our discussions with Jeff and Gerry yesterday, we thought that we should separate the CCRM / IT combined workshop from the kick-off event and have it separately on another day. Our overall game plan is to meet CCRM (which we are today) and IT this week so that we can structure a powerful combined workshop. I will share with you some of the ideas which we discussed when we meet in person.



Look forward to your comments and inputs.

We tried to research, but couldnt make a strong case of DB2 being superior to SAS especially in case of EDW. I am forwarding you a separate email, where Vasu has compiled a few data points. As you know, SAS has far too many facilities like formats, Informats etc. Nothing of much value could be found on Internet.

However, if we can convince of Microstrategy being the choice tool for reporting, then I suppose we are also selling the idea that we do not have our data in SAS datasets.

Subject: RE: BI tool comparison

Rahul,

This is very good document. I can definitely use this during presentation.
Now, let me explain the situation here.

We have 2 politically powerful groups in GoldBank:

1. Corporate risk department - They believe only in SAS. They have built their own mart in form of SAS datasets with relational structure using DI studio and create reports using SAS web report studio. Their mart does not pull data from EDW, but from OLTP directly.

2. IT - IT believes every user department should follow architecture standards laid down by IT. So they are trying to force DB2 for data storage, SAS for analytics, Informatica for ETL and Microstrategy for reporting. IT also is trying to force sourcing of data marts from EDW.

Personally, I feel in long run we need to create a mart on top of EDW using DB2 as data storage and SAS + Microstrategy for analytics and reporting respectively. And this is the reason, we need ammunition in form of comparisons to prove our points.

Can you get similar document prepared for 'DB2 V/S SAS' for data storage? We should highlight advantages of using DB2 for data storage, and disadvantages (which I am sure are none).
Can you create this deck by Thursday EOD? Give any examples, values etc that you may get.

Thanks,

Subject: BI tool comparison
Importance: High



Team,

I have an interesting task for which I need volunteers.

We are creating 'BI roadmap for credit risk' for GoldBank. There are 2 influential groups in client: one which favours SAS for standard reporting and one which favours Microstrategy for standard reporting and dashboarding.

My initial reaction is Microstrategy should be a a good choice. But to prove this, we need sound evidence.

Couple of years back we had done similar exercise for ACIC. In that case SAS was ranked much below Microstrategy. Enclosed is documentation for ACIC comparison.

What we need now is:

1. Take out comparison of SAS V/S Microstrategy from enclosed docs.

2. Some of the things must have changed (e.g.SAS has improved in standard reporting a lot in last couple of years). So validate which are still true.

3. Create a 8-10 slide PPT about SAS V/S Microstrategy for standard reporting. This PPT must be full with examples.

This is probably 12-16 hours of work and if 3-4 people work on it, it can be done in a day.

Let me know if anybody wants to volunteer.

Thanks,

kishor Deshpande

I had a quick look, at the attached PPT created by Vasu. I do not think, that the PPT can be presented, let us know if you think otherwise. 

The chWhitege is that we could not find enough data on the internet that we could find that substantiate the case.

This looks great. Ken Daniels has asked me to add a couple more business stakeholders, Pete Peterson for Sales Finance and Tim Dale for Mortgage to the interview list. I still need to contact them and determine if they or a designate will participate before we add and schedule them. I will try to do that today, but the agenda is pretty full and if I can't get there today, will do it tomorrow at the latest. Thanks.

Subject: Kick-off meeting presentation and discussion points.

Keith,



Hope you are doing well.



Attached is the draft version of the deck which we can use for the kick-off meeting.



In addition to the presentation which would last about 20 minutes. The other items are:

1. Presentation of the DataTech Reporting Framework and examples (20 minutes)
2. We would like to follow it up with a live demo of how this framework translates into business value. (20 minutes)


We can keep the meeting for 90 minutes so that if there are questions we can extend the discussions to accommodate folks.



In our meeting on Wednesday, we can fine tune this based on your inputs.



In our discussions with Jeff and Gerry yesterday, we thought that we should separate the CCRM / IT combined workshop from the kick-off event and have it separately on another day. Our overall game plan is to meet CCRM (which we are today) and IT this week so that we can structure a powerful combined workshop. I will share with you some of the ideas which we discussed when we meet in person.



Look forward to your comments and inputs.



Regards

Santosh

1. The reports focus on loss metrics for the segments and lobs
2. They have a couple of years of history on losses by segments.
3. Training and education of these concepts take a long time and is a key component for CCRM
4. Some of the analysis which are being done (which may feed reports) are:
	1. Prepayment analysis
	2. Term structure of defaults
	3. Life cycle / vintage analysis
	4. Migration analysis
5. I think there are 240 elements as opposed to 214.
6. They receive SAS data sets from ASD directly (to be confirmed) They are provided to them by Bill Starky.
7. Lack of meta data and the loose look-up tables for meta data needs to be mentioned.
8. The old reports will need to be transitioned to the new data.
9. LOBs have been providing them with inputs on changes to reports.
10. They do not have the time and resources to do a validate the data when it is received.

Hi Anish,



I am working at Madison Chester, North Carolina on a STT.

As per our SOW with client, any expenses towards stay here are billable to client. Accordingly, our entire team is staying in a hotel provided by client. We have to pay and charge back hotel expenses.



However, I am carrying with me Stored Value card of $2500. My per day hotel charge is about $100. Thus, at rate of $100 per day, my card will be completely utilized in 3 weeks.



Is there a way that company can directly pay to the hotel if I give project code? All this expense is billable to client.

Who is US team in Chicago can help in this?

As part of the analysis we are conducting, we are looking at the LPC reports. I wanted to compare what part of the data you currently have can be overlaid on them. Can you send me a sample Martin and Starkey file? Truncated versions will also work as we are interested in the field name and what the actual data is in them.

Want to emphasis one component of the engagement again that was briefly discussed yesterday. That component is the BI environment assessment. We are expecting a fairly in-depth review of that environment so that its adequacy for the \"to be\" can be defined. As we discussed yesterday, lack of a dev/test component would be a deficiency. This morning in another meeting there was an issue raised regarding the web server box perhaps pegging on memory/cpu. Let's don't just do a \"drive-by\" on this component and gloss it over. We want to know about potential deficiencies, like the web box, now and not when it becomes an issue. This all gets to scalability and extendibility. Historically we have not been great at being proactive around these types of issues and we need to change that for this environment. Thanks.

Thanks for sharing SAS program for generating reports.

We are looking for information about hardware configuration of existing CCRM environment.
Can you please send any information / documents you have about SAS server that has information about:
1. SAS server that runs ETL program (ETL_PRGM_ALL_LOB) and stores all extract files and SAS datasets.
2. SAS server that runs reporting program and publishes reports.
3. SAS server that hosts SAS interner portal.

Information we are looking for is:

1. Server name
2. CPU configuration (number of CPUs, proessor speed)
3. Disk size
4. Backup process for server

Can you share this information?

This is all fine, but I would like to temper future documentation and work with the following thoughts. First, as it relates to \"As Is\" from my perspective, this is not intended to be an exercise in criticism about the existing environments or those that own them or why they are the way there are. Realistically, you can only look at today's environment in one light; it represents the best implementation possible with the given constraints that have impacted it. Defining \"As Is\" at this stage of the game should represent generalizations that paint broad views...almost symptomatic views...of today's environment so we should avoid an exercise in \"hair-splitting\" in an attempt to be exactly, precisely, completely and without exception on target in definition of today's environment down to the minute detail. The reason for this is two-fold: first, as it relates to the end game such level of specifics is not required (I only need to know it has green characteristics to it, I don't need to know the formula for a precise shade of green...particularly if we are going to end up repainting it blue); second, it leads to extended debates and wordsmithing that is really not necessary because of the first reason. Different parties could argue various alternatives to what was done and how it was done, what could/should have been done, and prove or disprove various options. That is not the object of this effort. The object is to define the most optimal way going forward, not debate what we did in the past. So the point of this rambling is...yes, let's make sure the As Is is factual to the extent required to use it as a benchmark for the go forward, but let's not spend an undue amount of time in an effort trying to perfectly define this environment because much of the definition can be couched in \"eye of the beholder differences\" and based upon using different definitions of a given component. Santosh, I will leave it up to DataTech to define the level of detail that is required to create an \"As Is\" definition that allows you to make an adequate assessment of that world and to define a future state and plan at a high-level its implementation, but we need to stay on task and not get bogged down in defining the past. Thanks.

Hi Mandar,



I have not received any email from BSSI. If they have sent a postal mail, I can not check that till 4th April since I am out at client site at Madison and mail must have come to my residence in Atlanta.



Can you please extend enrolment date till 8th April?



Thanks,

Hi All,



Your enrollment date is going expire soon i.e. on 04/02/2008. Please note that you have to enroll before mentioned date. If you are not enrolled on time then you will not be eligible for benefits. I suppose, you have already received a mail from BSSI containing User name & Password. Kindly visit the BSSI website for your enrollment. Please note that you can enroll your dependents as well from same User ID & Password.



Kindly revert back for any clarification.

Description

This is a PDF that explains business rules applied during extraction for Mortgage. Though this document may not be in completely in synch with latest extract programs, it is a good base to start with. It also has detailed explanations about business rules and any assumptions made during deciding business rules. I have enclosed only Mortgage document, but I have documents for all other lines.


CreditRiskETL.xls


This document has mapping from source extracts to LGRED.


CreditRiskETL.doc


This document contains entire ETL flow for LGRED. We went through actual programs and found that this document is fairly accurate and very less difference compared to actual ETL.

This document is a Data Dictionary for 1st train LGRED.

We created this document to understand few business rules (just few sample, not all) from LGRED ETL

We created this flowchart to understand SAS ETL program (one that you referred to during our discussion)

Santosh,

Thanks. I am fine with the added assumptions and the reference to the as is and future state documents, with one exception. Section III.A.1 identifies that categories of reports, but it does not specifically identify or quantify the total number of reports or number of reports by category. In our proposal, we have assumed that we will develop some number of reports (or a range  i.e. up to X). We should include some statement to bound the number of reports. Please include and send back to me.



Assuming the reports are quantified as mentioned above, I rate this as green.

Bob,

Items listed in #1 are detailed in the current and future state documents which has been part of the assessment project. This has been referenced in the project assumptions (Page 12) as follows:



»         The GoldBank CCRM As-Is document as presented by DataTech represents an accurate depiction of the existing state.   

»         Any departures from the above mentioned As-Is document representing material changes in understanding discovered during Analysis and Design activities will be documented and reviewed with GoldBank project management for prioritization, pricing, and inclusion as change orders to this SOW.





Attached is the as-is and future state document which was submitted.



	1. # of source systems and # of mappings  Page 13 for the architecture and page 19 of the future state document
	2. # of reports to prototype   Section III.A.1 of the As-Is- Document
	3. # of reporting tools to evaluate  Future state document. Page 26 section 5.2.4
	4. # of reports to develop  As is document section III.A.1






I have added lines in the SOW which refer to these documents to make this more explicit.



I have added all points from #2 in the project assumptions.



Please let me know if this works.



Thanks

Gene,

I have reviewed the SOW for GoldBank and have the following suggestions/comments:

1. The SOW is lacking any quantification of scope and baseline of our estimates. These need to be included so that as things change, we have a baseline to refer the client to explain the change. We had to have made some assumptions around these to create our estimate, and we need to include these in the SOW. As example, items to be included are:
	1. # of source systems and # of mappings
	2. # of reports to prototype
	3. # of reporting tools to evaluate
	4. # of reports to develop
2. There are some critical assumptions that need to be added.
	1. We are not responsible for data quality. Client is responsible to resolve data quality issues, delays resulting from data quality will impact cost and schedule
	2. We are not responsible for hardware sizing. We will work with the client IT team, but they will make the final decision. ---We do not want to be on the hook for the h/w sizing and have the client come back to us to pay for more hardware if the sizing was not correct.
	3. We are not responsible for the performance of third party software, defects in third party software, or any delays that may result from these.
	4. There are no specific assumptions around the environments we require and when we expect them to be available. Since this could impact our timelines and productivity, we need to spell out what we require and when
3. Since most of this work is in 2009, are we including a rate increase for 2009?


Please make the changes to address the above and send me the next version.

Bob,

Items listed in #1 are detailed in the current and future state documents which has been part of the assessment project. This has been referenced in the project assumptions (Page 12) as follows:



;         The GoldBank CCRM As-Is document as presented by DataTech represents an accurate depiction of the existing state.   

;         Any departures from the above mentioned As-Is document representing material changes in understanding discovered during Analysis and Design activities will be documented and reviewed with GoldBank project management for prioritization, pricing, and inclusion as change orders to this SOW.





Attached is the as-is and future state document which was submitted.



	1. # of source systems and # of mappings  Page 13 for the architecture and page 19 of the future state document
	2. # of reports to prototype   Section III.A.1 of the As-Is- Document
	3. # of reporting tools to evaluate  Future state document. Page 26 section 5.2.4
	4. # of reports to develop  As is document section III.A.1






I have added lines in the SOW which refer to these documents to make this more explicit.



I have added all points from #2 in the project assumptions.



Please let me know if this works.



Thanks

Gene,

I have reviewed the SOW for GoldBank and have the following suggestions/comments:

1. The SOW is lacking any quantification of scope and baseline of our estimates. These need to be included so that as things change, we have a baseline to refer the client to explain the change. We had to have made some assumptions around these to create our estimate, and we need to include these in the SOW. As example, items to be included are:
	1. # of source systems and # of mappings
	2. # of reports to prototype
	3. # of reporting tools to evaluate
	4. # of reports to develop
1. There are some critical assumptions that need to be added.
	1. We are not responsible for data quality. Client is responsible to resolve data quality issues, delays resulting from data quality will impact cost and schedule
	2. We are not responsible for hardware sizing. We will work with the client IT team, but they will make the final decision. ---We do not want to be on the hook for the h/w sizing and have the client come back to us to pay for more hardware if the sizing was not correct.
	3. We are not responsible for the performance of third party software, defects in third party software, or any delays that may result from these.
	4. There are no specific assumptions around the environments we require and when we expect them to be available. Since this could impact our timelines and productivity, we need to spell out what we require and when
1. Since most of this work is in 2009, are we including a rate increase for 2009?


Please make the changes to address the above and send me the next version.

See my previous message. Unless we can state that this trip is solely for the purpose of GoldBank efforts, I would avoid expensing the trip.   I understand that we are under budget on the CCRM expenses but I think a $2000.00 airfare will raise some flags that wed like to avoid for now..

Hi Chris,



I have submitted expense reports for last 2 weeks of GoldBank CCRM project. Can you please approve the reports?



Santosh, Chris, I have 2 questions regarding expenses:



1. My ticket to India was booked using BI practice (India) project code and not GoldBank Code. Do we need to charge it to client? If yes, I can get the expenses charged to GoldBank code.

2. I am booking a cab from Mumbai airport to Mumbai (expense - $50). Should it be billable to client or non billable?

Though this is primarily for Q171, I was thinking that it will cover Q310 as well since both need to access Informatica and DB2.

I have tried to keep it simple as discussed during last friday call.

I assume these requirements are for the Q171D project?  Is this correct?    We have different requirements for the Q310 project.   Upendra and I are putting together the answers for our (Q310) needs and we probably need to combine the results in the end.  We can also let you know the exact access method being proposed after our initial meeting.

Once the extracts are transferred to CCRM SAS server, CCRM applies business rules.

Following are my answers:

1. No TEST / QA machine.   They are pretty formal here in moving from DEV -> TEST -> PROD.   Especially if you get caught up in the corporate standards.  
   - I will add a Test QA environment

2. Less memory on dev machines.   I wouldn't skimp on what is relatively cheap in the global sense.  I'd bump memory everywhere.
   - I will add memory to dev machines

3. No disk requirements on INFA boxes.   Need some flat file space for data landing and logs.   Not as much as Database but you might want to specify.   Also the type of RAID?  
   - I missed disk on INFA. I will add it. Did not add RAID as anyway we will have to use what GoldBank otherwise follows for INFA & UDB.

4. I'd definitly add more memory for database. 
  - Do you mean for production? I will increase it to 4 cores with 8 GB RAM.

5. Are you expecting Informatica to be dramatically slower than SAS.  I would not be surprised.  Relates to window.
 - I did not get this??

6. I am surpised that you can store the 1.2 TB of LGRED history in SAS datasets as 400 GB in DB2.   Or did I read that wrong?   I would expect DB2 space to be significantly higher.  
 - LGRED server has 1.2 TB, but not all is LGRED data. They do some ad hoc analysis and those ad hoc files are lying on same server. Data rate in LGRED was 3 GB per month and for 40 months, it would be about 120 GB. However, considering low price of disk, I will increase it to 1.5 TB. Also, if required we can add it later.

I will change the document and send to you ebfore sending to GoldBank.

Virendra, Rahul, Tony,

Brief background of project:

DataTech team (Santosh Kamat, kishor Deshpande and Sandesh Menon) recently delivered a 'BI Roadmap' project for credit risk in GoldBank. During this project we came across some SAS programs containing business rules which can be used by our team working on building a DW for GoldBank. During this proposed 3 week initiative, we will document business rules and provide it as a value added service to GoldBank.

We are expecting some BDW development and testing work to be offshored soon for GoldBank and knowledge gained in this 3 week initiative will be helpful in positioning DataTech team for more BDW work.

Tony, this is as per our discussion on 5/9. Please add if I have missed any point.

Can you please review minutes of meeting for today's call to discuss offshore connectivity setup?

Minutes of meeting of conference call to discuss connectivity options for DataTech offshore team:

1. Following connectivity method was agreed:
    For connecting to GoldBank network from offshore: A thin client based method to be used to connect to GoldBank network. A user ID and password to be used for authentication for this thin client based connectivity. Currently GoldBank has about 450 offshore resources connecting to using this method.

    Once logged into GoldBank network: Once logged into GoldBank network, \"VDI\" method to be used to access a remote desktop in GoldBank network. This might be either a pool of desktops for offshore team or a dedicated desktop for each resource. Usually GoldBank IT team requires 1 week to setup VDI infrastructure for a new resource.

2. Action items identified:
   a. Henry to give Susan the details of user ID and list of applications to be accessed by offshore team.
   b. Susan to fill out 'remote access requirement form'
   c. Susan to fill out audit form for getting VDI access.

Following are next steps on setting up connectivity for offshore:

1. Henry has to give following details to Susan : a. User ID of Parag (offshore tester) and b. Applications required to be connected from offshore.
2. Susan has to fill out 'remote access requirement form'. She will need help from henry in this.
3. After both the above steps are done, Susan has to fill 'Audit form for getting VDI Access'.

After Susan fills 'Audit form for getting VDI Access', GoldBank IT team will need 1-2 weeks for creating desktop in GoldBank network to which offshore resources will connect. Once the desktop is setup, offshore resource will connect to GoldBank network using web based access.

Evey time a new resource has to be added to offshore, all 3 steps are to be repeated.
This process is to be entirely carried out by GoldBank and since this is web based connectivity, there is no action item on DataTech apart from Henry helping Susan to fill out forms.

Suggestion - Looking at above process, every time we add a new resource, it will take 1 week to get ID & connectivity. To simplify the process, can we apply for IDs for 3 associates who are doing SAS code reverse engineering and get them IDs and connectivity? In that case we can ensure that these 3 associates continue on any future GoldBank project.

Henry, did you get a chance to send the following MOM to Susan and GoldBank IT team?

Earlier this week, we went through a very clean 15 minute deal review.  The keys were, in my opinion, the following:

1) We sent the proposal in advance to Bob Whinery to get his advice.  There are new QA processes and Bob will  always have feedback that we should try to take care of in advance.

-- As soon as it's clean, Henry should send to Bob and cc all.

2) We send to Kelly Jones 3 day in advance, so Legal was ready to go.

-- Henry or Chris can send.

3) We had the Deal Review deck to Randi the day before.

-- Chris to begin Deal Review deck -- call me if you need help.

Gentlemen,



I've tweaked this SOW some more.  I've got some more good comments coming from Beth, but she is still working on it and there is time for incorporation tonight.  



Also attached is the staffing plan by month with my assumed rates and personnel.   We'll need to pull that into the plan in a more formatted way at the appropriate spot.  



Anything that Sandesh and team can suggest, we will take into consideration in the morning.  Please take the liberty to incorporate the changes directly into this document.  Thanks for your help guys.

Sandesh and Harshpal,



I truly appreciate the great work you did on the TDBN SOW. It passed deal review today for 1.7M.  We are completing a fixed bid SOW for GoldBank and it's due tomorrow ET.  We are 75% complete, but I'm requesting a QA review and some possible work to help us find and re-use language from other SOW/Proposals for:



1) Acceptance Criteria

2) Change Control Process



Attached is our SOW at this point.  Henry will send a revised version before 9:00 PM ET.  Will you let us know if you can perform the QA and take on a few tasks for Henry tonight?



Thanks,



Sam

While I do not know what the language will be to allow us to utilize our offshore resources for Project. Work (because that will come from GoldBank), I recommend that you schedule a meeting with yourself, Jeff Spicer and Keith Martin to get this language/paragraph/amendment added to our PSA dated Jan 10, 2007.

In that way, you've got your GoldBank LOB buyer helping you to get Vendor Management to move forward with this.

You should emphasize that we already have received approval from GoldBank IT Security (Dan Votkevich and Joe Robbins) and the FSR has been submitted (under the BDW Project) to put into place the site-to-site VPN between GoldBank and DataTech India.

Therefore, adding the amendment/language to our existing PSA for offshore delivery on Project work is all that remains to close this loop.

Sam, Tony,



We are confident of Somnath's ability to deliver this project.

In fact he has delivered projects with similar (and slight higher) scope in GE & FirstBank. Biggest advantage with Somnath is he is also Informatica architect and can play a dual role if required.



He will be back in India next week and we can start his B1 visa immediately. Also after some time, we can start L1 visa. After spending 1 month in US, he can come back to India for a week and can get his L1 stamped. This is how we had sent Upendra to US.



Also, we can have a discussion between Somnath and Henry towards end of next week.

Sam,



Here is a resource that kishor has sent over that may be able to play the PM role on the Integration project.



kishor  My concern is the timeframe that we will need to get his visa processed.  Since this is a Fixed Bid, we could bring him over on a B Visa, but I think that we are limited to 6  8 weeks in the US.

Subject: Project Manager for GoldBank BDW implementation



Tony,



With reference to our discussion today, please find enclosed resume of Somnath More.



He has about 8 years BI & Datawarehousing experience. His entire experience is in implementation of DW solutions for FS clients like FirstBank & GE. He has implemented 8 datawarehouse implementations for FirstBank in various capacities like analyst, team lead and PM. Apart from playing role of Project Manager, he has also been an Informatica ETL architect for GE projects. He has managed large teams for FirstBank & GE.



Currently Somnath is in UK participating in FSA project negotiations. He will be back in India in next 2 weeks and can travel to US after that. He does not have US visa, but we can get his L1 done in 3 weeks or B1 in lesser duration.



I have worked with Somnath for 5 years and my opinion is we can not get a better profile than Somnath's for GoldBank PM position.



I will call you after 8 AM CST to discuss this.



Thanks,



kishor Deshpande

Sorry about the delay, but I have added my comments into the document.  



Couple of quick suggestions.



1. Chris  You need to get this deal in SFDC or in an excel worksheet with the cost information so that we can confirm the margin and the contingency
2. We need to model the actual expenses.  We are currently running at about $25K per month but will be adding some resources onsite and travel from offshore.  We need to confirm our run rate (I put $30K per month but I am not sure what this will be.  Gene has some information that can be leveraged for this so once we have the staffing sheet confirmed, Chris please work with Gene to calculate the travel.  I would like to get away from providing them actuals if possible.  At $30K per month, we are only billing them about 9% of revenue vs 15% ($240K) that we usually estimate, so we need to tie these numbers down before committing them.  I would prefer to keep it at 10  12% but we need the actuals.
3. For the milestone payments, we need to make sure that we are above our T&M run-rate for payments otherwise we will get screwed if they kill the project midstream.
4. Once Henry cleans it up, please send it to our Marketing Approvals group to get it cleaned up.  You may even ask them to help with the table formatting if necessary.


I would suggest targeting getting it complete from an input, pricing, and review perspective by COD on Wednesday and schedule a final review if possible so that legal can start their reviews



Chris  Please drive this process.



Let me know if you have any questions.

Henry,



Following are my comments on this:




Section


Comment


1.3.5 Resource plan


In case of USM à BDW ETL, we can have offshore lead continue till Oct instead of just the developer continuing till October. This might be important from costing perspective as rate of offshore lead (internal charge back rate_ might be higher than that of offshore developer


1.3.5 Resource plan


Since testing team is continuing till Oct, it is important to have Praveen (test lead) continue till Oct as he has overall understanding of testing in BDW


1.3.5 Resource plan


Are we considering UDB DBA as an onsite position or offshore position? If it is offshore position, we need to start searching for suitable profile ASAP (and not wait for SOW to be signed). This is because we do not have any UDB DBA on bench and hiring UDB DBA in India is a time consuming process.


1.3.5 Resource plan


You might need resource levels for coming up with pricing sheet as suggested by Tony. You can assume following resource levels for offshore related positions:



Offshore ETL developer (HUB à USM and USM à BDW)  Consultant

Offshore lead (HUB à USM and USM à BDW)  Senior Consultant

Offshore test lead à Senior Consultant

Offshore tester à Associate Consultant

Reverse Engineering developer à 3 Associate Consultants + 1 Senior Consultant

Onshore Coordinator assistant à Senior Consultant


1.3.6 Pricing


Have we accounted for charge for connectivity in our monthly expenses? If you would like to know the rates, please check with Gene. We had calculated rates during CCRM pricing.



Thanks,

Sriram who was interviewed by Adam and Beth yesterday and who has selected for offshore developer position has L1 visa and can travel onsite. Can we consider him for onsite position? We need to consider visa availability for deciding onsite positions.

Thanks,

Here is where we stand.

I think using the three persons we have dong the SAS code analysis to get the access established is a good angle.   Can I get the full names and SSN / Passport number?  I've talked with Susan and she has agreed to get the process started with them.   Do these folks have Informatica development experience in case we need to interview for off shore developer postions?

It may take a week to get these userids assigned.   That is the first wait gate.

Then Susan will fill out the VDI form with the assigned userids.   That will be another week wait.   I helped her with one of these forms today.    A lot of technical stuff in there about server names and IP addresses - we have 15 servers to access.  

We still need that paragraph appended to our Master Agreement which authorizes us for offshore work - according to Gene.    We need to decide who will address that, how and when between Chris Upendra and me.

Subject: GoldBank connectivity - next steps

Chris,



Following are next steps on setting up connectivity for offshore:



1. Henry has to give following details to Susan : a. User ID of Parag (offshore tester) and b. Applications required to be connected from offshore.

2. Susan has to fill out 'remote access requirement form'. She will need help from henry in this.

3. After both the above steps are done, Susan has to fill 'Audit form for getting VDI Access'.



After Susan fills 'Audit form for getting VDI Access', GoldBank IT team will need 1-2 weeks for creating desktop in GoldBank network to which offshore resources will connect. Once the desktop is setup, offshore resource will connect to GoldBank network using web based access.



Evey time a new resource has to be added to offshore, all 3 steps are to be repeated.

This process is to be entirely carried out by GoldBank and since this is web based connectivity, there is no action item on DataTech apart from Henry helping Susan to fill out forms.



Suggestion - Looking at above process, every time we add a new resource, it will take 1 week to get ID & connectivity. To simplify the process, can we apply for IDs for 3 associates who are doing SAS code reverse engineering and get them IDs and connectivity? In that case we can ensure that these 3 associates continue on any future GoldBank project.



Henry, did you get a chance to send the following MOM to Susan and GoldBank IT team?

Minutes of meeting of conference call to discuss connectivity options for DataTech offshore team:



1. Following connectivity method was agreed:

    For connecting to GoldBank network from offshore: A thin client based method to be used to connect to GoldBank network. A user ID and password to be used for authentication for this thin client based connectivity. Currently GoldBank has about 450 offshore resources connecting to using this method.



    Once logged into GoldBank network: Once logged into GoldBank network, \"VDI\" method to be used to access a remote desktop in GoldBank network. This might be either a pool of desktops for offshore team or a dedicated desktop for each resource. Usually GoldBank IT team requires 1 week to setup VDI infrastructure for a new resource.



2. Action items identified:

   a. Henry to give Susan the details of user ID and list of applications to be accessed by offshore team.

   b. Susan to fill out 'remote access requirement form'

   c. Susan to fill out audit form for getting VDI access.

Isn't there any way we can have Abhijit work from India during US day time or from Chicago for 2 weeks? Unfortunately, this cannot be possible given the tight schedule we have on HUB for this release. We need someone in the office as soon as possible. my concern is that we might loose this opportunity. This could be our second chance to get back the testers positions from HUB.

If everything is settled with Abha, then since we can bring her in immediately, she would be the right choice for this position. We (all of us in this email) should definitely discuss this on early Monday hours so that we can take a decision as early as possible.

Praveen,

I tried calling you to discuss this.
There are 2 things that need to be resolved:
1. Abha's concerns - I will talk to her on Monday and if required we can get into a call to talk about this.
2. Legal issues - I have already raised a request with our Immigration team (Georgeann Bosco in Chicago ) to verify that there are no legal issues in she traveling to NC on L1. As per my knowledge, it should be possible as I and Sandesh both traveled to Madison on L1. But let us wait till Monday yo hear back from Georgeann.

In short, we will finalize this on Monday.

kishor,

Abhijit was good but his H1 is an issue. We cannot afford to wait for another 2 weeks from a project standpoint.

Abha seems to be a good fit for this roll considering her Visa status. However, she has some concerns with respect to her stay and commute here. If these can be resolved then I can send a confirmation email to Susan about her travel to the USA.

Praveen,



Please find enclosed resumes of:



1. Abha Bhende
2. Abhijit Valsangkar


Both Abhijit and Abha have about 9 years experience mainly in databases, SQL and testing. Both of them have H1 visa.

I am scheduling their interviews between 9:30  10:30 AM on Friday.



If you like their profile, we can train these associates in Informatica.

We would need to transfer visa for these associates to allow them to work in North Carolina.

kishor,



I had a discussion with Susan today and convinced her that we need another resource on the Q310 HUB project. She understands and approved that we do need someone as soon as possible. This resource is going to be on-shore and we definitely need a resource with the right Visa status (L1 or B1 would be better). 



We need someone with good SQL skills but most importantly very good communication skills. Please find attached the job description for this resource.



Could you  please work your magic and get us the resource as soon as possible?



I appreciate your help.

Please find enclosed detailed project plan for CCRM project.



Key points that I would like to highlight are as follows:



Mapping:

1. In CCRM, we will have assumed that Santosh will be guiding the business analyst team in data mapping and will provide business inputs. This will help in efficient data mapping. We have already considered 175 man days effort for data mapping. In addition, before data mapping exercise, a detailed data profiling exercise will be undertaken this will help in mapping.
2. Business analysts doing mapping will be trained on CCRM data and LGRED before the project starts. In fact, 2 of the BAs are already familiar with LGRED & CCRM as they have participated in SAS code reverse engineering.


Testing:

1. In the enclosed document, I have listed detailed tasks for testing. We have assumed separate tasks for unit testing, UAT, integration testing, test data preparation and test case preparation.
2. After UAT, we have a 3 month parallel run of CCRM mart with LGRED. This is extended user testing. During this phase, we will compare data of LGRED with new CCRM mart and will resolve issues. This has been highlighted in our future state document also. LGRED will be decommissioned only after 3 months successful parallel run.
3. Apart from testing team, the Onsite Coordinator will be leading the testing phase. Onsite coordinator role will be played by a senior Informatica lead with testing experience.
4. During User acceptance testing, apart from testing team, the SME & Architect will be involved to resolve user queries.


Handover:

1. A team consisting of SME (Santosh), Architect and Project Manager will conduct 3 week workshops for CCRM team to make them familiar with data.
2. We have assumed separate 4 week effort for scheduling of jobs in production.


Other general points:

1. Key differences between BDW & CCRM mart are:

BDW


CCRM mart


Total 300+ tables


Maximum 35 tables (In this phase we are just migrating existing LRED to DB2. LGRED has 40-50 columns per LOB)


Total 3000+ columns


Maximum 225 columns


Highly normalized making it complex for ETL


Completely denormalized fact dimension structures.



I would like to do a walkthrough of the plan with you and if required revise the plan before Thursdays call with GoldBank team. Please let me know suitable time for discussion.



Thanks,

1) Development DBA is on the cost worksheet as one of the \"Data Analysts\".   There was some sensitivity to the title DBA.

2) If you look at the worksheet more carefully, you will see that these costs for the off-shore coordinators are for only a four week period.  We did put in a contingency to bring them over for an indoctrination if needed. 

3) DRL developer is a one-time migration job.  We hope to not have to take the document of this to the level of formality to take off-shore.   in addition, this should not take nearly as much time as indicated on the spreadsheet.   We plan on having extra resource to leverage on shore with this role.  

4) The latest excel workbook shows 225 rate for Sr manager and 185 for manager.

Tony, Henry,



I have following questions:



1. Development DBA is not shown in Resource and Cost by Month worksheet.
2. HUB à USM OS Lead is an offshore based position. Same is true about USM à BDW lead. However, we have assumed travel and stay costs for these 2 resources. Either we need to change them to onsite resource or take out expenses for these roles.
3. Can we move DRL developer role to offshore? If it is just support role, we can move it to offshore. Since we are competing on cost with CTS, even $15000 saving might be good.
4. Slide number 5 of Deal review PPT sent by Tony yesterday shows 49% profit for both Manager and senior manager architects both with rates of $185. This is corrected in latest excel, but needs to be corrected in PPT.


Thanks,

Sandhya has done very good in the interview and she can definitely be the 2nd offshore resource for BDW. Could we have Aashish as a non-billable resource for this project? Having an extra resource might help us as a back up and can pitch in whenever needed. Just a thought.

Henry/Chris - We now have the full test team for BDW. Once we have the connectivity ready from offshore we can kick off the offshore testing work.

The GoldBank BDW Integration Project deal was approved during our call on June 4, 2008. The  above reflects the accurate final metrics, action items and Bid Control Sheet.  The deal is officially approved under these terms unless one of you replies back with clarification or a dissenting opinion by close of business tomorrow  you do not need to reply to approve the deal.  The attorney will stay involved with the team and notify us if there are any new issues that need to be reviewed / approved.

Contract Stage Action Items


Action Item


Status


1.       The Pursuit QA Review was rated Yellow prior to the deal review. Manjot Sohi exchanged e-mails with Henry Miller to gather more information. Based on that e-mail exchange, the Pursuit QA Rating was changed to Green during the deal review.  No further action is required of the team from a QA perspective.


1.       Noted


2.       Discussion Points: This is the 1st significant offshore work for GoldBank IT. The costs for the infrastructure set-up and connectivity are factored into the price. Gene White must document the e-mail trail regarding infrastructure so that we dont get hit with an unexpected bill. In the staffing model, the leaders on the project will do QA for the project. kishor Deshpande will play a role along with the leadership. The onshore team will have a formal QA and signoff procedure.


2.       Pending


3.       Per Ashish Raina: The team should consider budgeting for 1 person dedicated to QA Activity. $60,000 in expenses for 5 months will be paid by the client. To cover day-day lodging / food / travel.


3.       Pending


4.       Per Anand Ramakrishnan: We can manage our costs better by only having 2 offshore resources come over from India instead of 5 resources. The team will review this as an option. The concern is that we dont want to see a drop in margin once the project begins. Regarding contingency: Although 12.5 % is approved, the team should consider 15%.


4.       Pending


5.       Anand Ramakrishnan approved that the pursuit team move forward based on the data he has reviewed. He wants the team to look at what we can do to drive the margins upwards and what room there is for negotiation.

A key fact is that we need someone who can come on for $85 an hour.    We will most likely loose the position to CTS if more.

kishor,



Sandhya has done very good in the interview and she can definitely be the 2nd offshore resource for BDW. Could we have Aashish as a non-billable resource for this project? Having an extra resource might help us as a back up and can pitch in whenever needed. Just a thought.



Henry/Chris - We now have the full test team for BDW. Once we have the connectivity ready from offshore we can kick off the offshore testing work.

kishor,



I'm looking over your documents here tonight before the meeting tomorrow.   Chris spoke of four documents and I only got two in your email below.  Neither is the current or future state Chris speaks of.   I did get a copy of current state from Upendra, but it appears that I don't have the main document - future state.   This will put us at somewhat of a disadvantage if we are trying to present a unified front.

We have a large regional banking client who is about to begin coding on an EDW effort, using IBM's BDW reference model, but is now seriously considering pulling the plug on funding or deferring in favor of a Data Mart project that has better political sponsorship in the bank.  We are the lead on both projects and would like to convince the client to continue development of the EDW.

We have completed the design phase and have a very flexible technical architecture that has been approved, but we may be losing the perception battle with executive management and we need to educate the client on the business benefits of the hub and spoke approach.

Can any of you think of any very strong presentations, white papers or arguments in favor of the central EDW model and how to justify the investment in the infrastructure?

I have attached two slides with the basic architecture and game plan.  Any ideas that come to mind will be appreciated.  We will be presenting on Wednesday of this week, so quick thoughts or leads are best.  Again, we're also working directly with the business to develop a credit risk mart that is being approved, but believe that it will be a huge waste of resources and investment to shut down the EDW effort at this point (2 years of prior investment before we arrived and 9 months of effort with our team).

Here are my thoughts on this:



1. To your point number 3  We can definitely use USM as source for CCRM instead of HUB. Only thing we have committed is that we will use enterprise data source which can be USM or HUB. Thus, I think we should not talk about point 3 and instead stress that both BDW & CCRM using USM as source will be a good thing.
2. EDW is always a Data provisioning environment and not data access layer for business. GoldBank can not build other marts on top of CCRM mart as it is just a mart for credit risk and does not contain other data. If BDW is built, it can serve as a common data source for all marts. Thus, time & effort required for building subsequent marts will be greatly reduced if BDW is built as compared to absence of BDW.
3. Federated marts require a great deal of governance in place. For sharing dimensions among various marts and departments, you need common definitions of data, agreement between various LOBs, single IT strategy among LOBs which is clearly lacking in GoldBank. In absence of strong governance federated mart approach would be difficult to implement and GoldBank will end up having numerous marts with MS Access, SAS, and DB2 etc.
In contrast, if EDW is built, it can be foundation for strong governance. BDW will enable various departments to agree / discuss disagreements about definitions.

1. GoldBank is rethinking on BDW may be because of long time it has taken to build it. But anywhere in other banks too, it takes a long time to build a stable EDW. Thus, GoldBank is not an exception.
2. GoldBank has a large number of subsidiaries. Implementing federated mart for these subsidiaries will mean these subs marts will remain isolated islands as it is now. It makes more sense to go for EDW approach if an organization has multiple entities for which putting in place a single IT / governance strategy is difficult. GoldBank has multiple disparate entities for which implementing federated mart approach would be difficult and EDW is most suitable.


Other thing we can do is: we can have them talk to senior management from any client where we have implemented EDW (e.g. FirstBank). I can not guarantee FirstBank will agree for this, but we can talk to Ranjana / Shri if they can help us.

Subject: RE: Justifying the EDW...



I've got to be quick with highlights here due to battery low and no power cord.  I'll rememdy that tomorrow. 



1) A great portion of the work is already done. 



Architecture



database design



Most mapping documents



The riskiest parts of the project have been attempted.  All that is left is the mechnical build out with mostly off shore resources.



2) If we truely have committment to use USM like layer between both CCRM and BDW projects, there is huge synergy. 



GL, ILS and CLS are already being developed by 310.   This can be taken and expanded by CCRM which should contribute towards reducing overall cost. 



BDW already has corporate hierarchies and ILS.  Perhaps a gap analysis should be done to see what can be leverage immediately.  



If CCRM plugs in to USM, then by default, it can be put into the BDW - huge.



We will need a concept modification for the USM to make its use easire for USM - but no problems there.  We need it for BDW also.   Might actually be a selling point. 



3) The difficulity of using the Hub to the USM directly may be underestimated.   All indications are that CCRM does not know the original sources and / or the hub - missing link.  



4) If things need to be cut budget wise between the projects, then we should do it wisely.

Henry,



I think we need to set a time w/ Susan, followed by a time with Mike O'Brien and possibly Will Shupe to explain the business case for continuing the EDW track.  Do you have any initial thoughts on how we should approach this and who should be involved?  We can tap into additional DataTech talent, but they would need to work with you as we build a story.  I don't want to go off in a dozen directions and need your help to organize a response.  Let's discuss today and work with Chris to set some times.

GoldBank is in complete disarray. Business is justifying CCRM datamart project and business is not interested in EDW as it has taken long time and GoldBank IT has not been able to deliver.



Now first IT tried to point out issues in building CCRM. After business justified CCRM, GoldBank IT is trying to scrap EDW project. They have spent 2 years and millions of dollars on building EDW and now that they are close to completion, they are thinking of scrapping it.



I have written a separate mail justifying EDW to Sam. I have forwarded it to you.

Subject: Call for Help on defending an EDW vs. Federated Marts



All,



We have a large regional banking client who is about to begin coding on an EDW effort, using IBM's BDW reference model, but is now seriously considering pulling the plug on funding or deferring in favor of a Data Mart project that has better political sponsorship in the bank.  We are the lead on both projects and would like to convince the client to continue development of the EDW.



We have completed the design phase and have a very flexible technical architecture that has been approved, but we may be losing the perception battle with executive management and we need to educate the client on the business benefits of the hub and spoke approach.



Can any of you think of any very strong presentations, white papers or arguments in favor of the central EDW model and how to justify the investment in the infrastructure?



I have attached two slides with the basic architecture and game plan.  Any ideas that come to mind will be appreciated.  We will be presenting on Wednesday of this week, so quick thoughts or leads are best.  Again, we're also working directly with the business to develop a credit risk mart that is being approved, but believe that it will be a huge waste of resources and investment to shut down the EDW effort at this point (2 years of prior investment before we arrived and 9 months of effort with our team).



Best regards,



Sam

I agree with most, but need just a couple of clarifications.  


1)  You cannot use the USM for a source instead of Hub.  USM is only a staging area.   Only the sources we (310)  are using will go through this staging area and have code developed (ILS, CLS and GL).   Any sources you need beyond that, you will need to send through the USM yourself. 

2)  I agree with this one. 

3) I agree with this, but I have never heard GoldBank discussing federated marts.   Let's not give them ideas:)

4) I think we need the facts here.   IBM was brought in to do a proof of concept with the BDW several years ago.   Then it went stagnant.   They have not made any attempts to enhance the BDW until our engagement.   So GoldBank effort is dramatically lower than many of the banks I have seen.   I hope to keep it that way, but politics are trying to kill it.  

5) There's that federated mart word again.  On the maturity scale, the first thing they will be doing is totally independent marts with no visibility to each other.   It is kind of interesting that they tackled the BDW to begin with.   many groups are saying they need this and governance - using different words.

Henry,



Here are my thoughts on this:



1. To your point number 3  We can definitely use USM as source for CCRM instead of HUB. Only thing we have committed is that we will use enterprise data source which can be USM or HUB. Thus, I think we should not talk about point 3 and instead stress that both BDW & CCRM using USM as source will be a good thing.
2. EDW is always a Data provisioning environment and not data access layer for business. GoldBank can not build other marts on top of CCRM mart as it is just a mart for credit risk and does not contain other data. If BDW is built, it can serve as a common data source for all marts. Thus, time & effort required for building subsequent marts will be greatly reduced if BDW is built as compared to absence of BDW.
3. Federated marts require a great deal of governance in place. For sharing dimensions among various marts and departments, you need common definitions of data, agreement between various LOBs, single IT strategy among LOBs which is clearly lacking in GoldBank. In absence of strong governance federated mart approach would be difficult to implement and GoldBank will end up having numerous marts with MS Access, SAS, and DB2 etc.
In contrast, if EDW is built, it can be foundation for strong governance. BDW will enable various departments to agree / discuss disagreements about definitions.

1. GoldBank is rethinking on BDW may be because of long time it has taken to build it. But anywhere in other banks too, it takes a long time to build a stable EDW. Thus, GoldBank is not an exception.
2. GoldBank has a large number of subsidiaries. Implementing federated mart for these subsidiaries will mean these subs marts will remain isolated islands as it is now. It makes more sense to go for EDW approach if an organization has multiple entities for which putting in place a single IT / governance strategy is difficult. GoldBank has multiple disparate entities for which implementing federated mart approach would be difficult and EDW is most suitable.


Other thing we can do is: we can have them talk to senior management from any client where we have implemented EDW (e.g. FirstBank). I can not guarantee FirstBank will agree for this, but we can talk to Ranjana / Shri if they can help us.

I've got to be quick with highlights here due to battery low and no power cord.  I'll rememdy that tomorrow. 



1) A great portion of the work is already done. 



Architecture



database design



Most mapping documents



The riskiest parts of the project have been attempted.  All that is left is the mechnical build out with mostly off shore resources.



2) If we truely have committment to use USM like layer between both CCRM and BDW projects, there is huge synergy. 



GL, ILS and CLS are already being developed by 310.   This can be taken and expanded by CCRM which should contribute towards reducing overall cost. 



BDW already has corporate hierarchies and ILS.  Perhaps a gap analysis should be done to see what can be leverage immediately.  



If CCRM plugs in to USM, then by default, it can be put into the BDW - huge.



We will need a concept modification for the USM to make its use easire for USM - but no problems there.  We need it for BDW also.   Might actually be a selling point. 



3) The difficulity of using the Hub to the USM directly may be underestimated.   All indications are that CCRM does not know the original sources and / or the hub - missing link.  



4) If things need to be cut budget wise between the projects, then we should do it wisely.



Most obvious from the surface is to eliminate a source from 310.  Not a majority portion of the work and it leads to visible scope change.



There are a number of other portions of 310 that can be eliminated which do not accect stated deliverables.   Scope creep has happening and is happening.  It need to be shut down regardless.



Data model modificiations to eliminate redundancies which were not addressed during physicalization will reduce effort. 



5) We are coding now - whole team fails if it is stopped.  This will be hard to recover from - ever.   Both from team and corporate perspective.



6) We CAN do this.   There have been too many pauses.  Let us do our job.



7) We need to eliminate the foolishness.   Fixed bid should address that.

Consolidated notes and talking points for Susan tomorrow...





1) The majority of the work is done and the team is ready to code.  It will be very difficult to recover the lost momentum and sunk cost if development is halted now.



* Architecture -- done



* Database design -- done



* Most mapping documents -- done



Arguably, the riskiest parts of the project have been completed or tested. The work that remains is the mechanical build out with mostly off shore resources.





2) CCRM can use the USM layer between both CCRM and BDW projects, which will promote re-use and more efficient design.



* GL, ILS and CLS are already being developed by 310.   This effort can be taken and expanded by CCRM, which should contribute towards reducing overall cost. 



* BDW already has corporate hierarchies and ILS.  Perhaps a gap analysis should be done to see what hierarchies can be leveraged immediately.  



* If CCRM plugs in to USM, then by default, the CCRM data elements can be promoted into the BDW.  That would be a huge win.



3) Data Marts are needed for Treasury, Finance and other LOBs.  BDW will greatly reduce the cost, time to market, consistency and reliability of these efforts.



Other Marts cannot built completely on top of CCRM.  The BDW cuts the time by as much as 50% of each one of these downstream marts.  Otherwise, each Mart bears the full burden of sourcing from raw data.



4) Without the EDW, an unwieldy, federated approach will be required by default. 



Data Governance will be much more difficult to implement effectively without a central point of reference and integration.  For sharing dimensions among various marts and departments, you need common definitions of data, agreement between various LOBs, single IT strategy among LOBs which is clearly lacking in GoldBank. In absence of strong governance federated mart approach would be difficult to implement and GoldBank will end up having numerous marts with MS Access, SAS, and DB2 etc. In contrast, if EDW is built, it would be the foundation for strong governance. BDW will enable various departments to expose and resolve disagreements about definitions.

2. We can make designation of 1 offshore tester as 'Consultant' instead of Senior Consultant making it slightly cost effective.
3. In testing part, we have (Onsite / Offshore) ratio of 3:2. Is there a way to make it 2:3? In short, is it possible to move 1 testing position offshore? This is $80000 saving.
4. Though we have discussed this, I feel moving DRL developer position offshore is possible.
5. Can we move more than 1 positions out of (Data Analyst 1, 2, DRL developer, Developer) offshore?

Hi,



As we know we have a situation where we have less number of visa ready associates and more onsite requirements. In view of this, can we consider following proposal?

We have tried to ensure that all 3 accounts get at least 1 visa ready ETL developer and all visa ready associates are utilized for onsite positions.



TDBN:

Business Analyst:

1. Jamil Khan
2. Bryan Parfitt
3. Abhijit Valsangkar


ETL Developer: (all onsite)

1. Brij Ganesh
2. Sriram Chokkalingam
3. TBD (We have scheduled interview of Vasu Dev Koti today with Tom and Howard for this position)


Compass: (onsite)

1. Rafikul Islam


GoldBank:

Development:

1. Narendra Prajapati (Onsite - Since he has visa and can travel onsite, I recommend we move him from testing to development since development requirement is onsite)
2. Veera Boppudi (Offshore)


Testing:

1.      Abha Bhende (Onsite and then offshore - We can process B1 visa for her and get her onsite for 3-4 weeks. She was interviewed by Praveen and selected. Only reason she was not in original list was because we wanted her to travel immediately and she did not have a valid visa.)

2.    Sandhya Jampala (Offshore)

3.    Aashish Joshi (non billable  Offshore))



Action Items:



1. Chris / Henry to send requisition numbers for GoldBank allocation ASAP.
2. Howard / Tom to send project code for travel and visa charges for TDBN.
3. Yashita to create TNF form for Brij and Sriram (if we agree to have him in TDBN)


I am scheduling a conference call on Tuesday morning US time to discuss this.

Tom - from what I understand, here is the summary -



1) BAs (3 needed) - we are good to go on these -



a) Jamil Khan

b) Bryan Parfitt

c) Abhijit Valsangkar



2) ETL developers (3 needed) - this is where we have an overlap on some names -



a) Brij Ganesh - good to go



The other 2 slots are still open considering the overlaps -



b) Rafikul Islam - with Compass Bank

c) Narendra Prajapati - with GoldBank

d) Sriram Chockalingam - with GoldBank



kishor - please confirm my understanding as given above. Given that Narendra & Sriram both have US visas, we should swap them on GoldBank with offshore folks as the GoldBank needs are primarily offshore.



Also request you to please publish the names being considered/ finalized for Compass Bank so that we can get a consolidated view of all the needs and names available.

Jaideep,



Just to avoid confusion, please provide Howard, Sam and I a list of the resources that will be allocated to this project asap. There are projects at GoldBank and Compass that have also requested allocations of some of the same resources. We just need to know asap if we need to continue to look for additional resources for this project.



Thanks

Sam,



Howard and I have screened well over 20 resumes and conducted 12 interviews in our search to fill the remaining six positions. We have selected the following people - in order of preference to fill the following roles:

BA (three required)

1. Jamil Khan

2. Abhijit Valsangkar

3. Bryan Parfitt



ETL (three required)

1. Rafikul Islam

2. Sriram Chokkalingam

3. Brij Ganesh

4. Narendra Prajapati



Since the order is signed and we are officially starting this week, we need to proceed with bringing in the resources as soon as possible.  My understanding is that Sunil has tagged Rafikul for Compass to backfill Syam. I agreed to this given the gap that will be created by Syam's departure. However I learned today there is a potential issue with his Visa. As far as the GoldBank resources, we need to understand if any of the resources that we have identified for this project are now no longer available. Please let Howard and I know the next steps to confirm the resources that will be assigned to the TDBN project and when they will arrive in Portland, Maine. Howard and I will provide recommendations for hotels and help with arrangements where possible.

Hi,



As we know we have a situation where we have less number of visa ready associates and more onsite requirements. In view of this, can we consider following proposal?

We have tried to ensure that all 3 accounts get at least 1 visa ready ETL developer and all visa ready associates are utilized for onsite positions.



TDBN:

Business Analyst:

1. Jamil Khan
2. Bryan Parfitt
3. Abhijit Valsangkar


ETL Developer: (all onsite)

1. Brij Ganesh
2. Sriram Chokkalingam
3. TBD (We have scheduled interview of Vasu Dev Koti today with Tom and Howard for this position)


Compass: (onsite)

1. Rafikul Islam


GoldBank:

Development:

1. Narendra Prajapati (Onsite - Since he has visa and can travel onsite, I recommend we move him from testing to development since development requirement is onsite)
2. Veera Boppudi (Offshore)


Testing:

1.      Abha Bhende (Onsite and then offshore - We can process B1 visa for her and get her onsite for 3-4 weeks. She was interviewed by Praveen and selected. Only reason she was not in original list was because we wanted her to travel immediately and she did not have a valid visa.)

2.    Sandhya Jampala (Offshore)

3.    Aashish Joshi (non billable  Offshore))



Action Items:



1. Chris / Henry to send requisition numbers for GoldBank allocation ASAP.
2. Howard / Tom to send project code for travel and visa charges for TDBN.
3. Yashita to create TNF form for Brij and Sriram (if we agree to have him in TDBN)


I am scheduling a conference call on Tuesday morning US time to discuss this.



Thanks,

Tom - from what I understand, here is the summary -



1) BAs (3 needed) - we are good to go on these -



a) Jamil Khan

b) Bryan Parfitt

c) Abhijit Valsangkar



2) ETL developers (3 needed) - this is where we have an overlap on some names -



a) Brij Ganesh - good to go



The other 2 slots are still open considering the overlaps -



b) Rafikul Islam - with Compass Bank

c) Narendra Prajapati - with GoldBank

d) Sriram Chockalingam - with GoldBank



kishor - please confirm my understanding as given above. Given that Narendra & Sriram both have US visas, we should swap them on GoldBank with offshore folks as the GoldBank needs are primarily offshore.



Also request you to please publish the names being considered/ finalized for Compass Bank so that we can get a consolidated view of all the needs and names available.



Regards,

As I have mentioned earlier and Sam has also mentioned, we are proposing just one resource change. i.e.  Abha Bhende getting added to the team.

She has 7 years experience (as compared to 3 years for Sriram Chokkalingam) and has extensive experience in testing.

She has already been interviewed by Praveen for testing position and he had liked her profile (please see enclosed mail). Only reason of not considering her originally was that she did not have visa and Praveen wanted her to travel within 3-4 days.

However, we can get a business visa for her and she can travel within 10 days.



Thus, I dont think we are proposing a new candidate.

In short, new team will look like this:



Development:

X       Narendra Prajapati (has visa, was interviewed by Adam and Beth. He moves from testing to development)

X       Veeranjaneyulu Boppudi (was interviewed by Adam and Beth. No change)



Testing:

X       Sandhya Jampala (was interviewed by Praveen. No change)

X       Abha Bhende (was interviewed by Praveen. We can get her business visa in 10 days. She being senior of the 2 testers, will travel onsite for short duration)

Chris,



This will be my 3rd e-mail to explain the decision made.  Please call me directly.



We are talking about one (1) change and we would lose this resource anyway, because he will soon quit unless he gets a US-based engagement. Another resource has been recommended and Henry and team wants to interview this candidate and wants other highly qualified candidates.  I'm sure that kishor and Vivek will do the best they can, but we simply don't have enough resources and we had to triage.  There has to be some compromise.  Neither Compass or TDBN has complete coverage and everyone is working hard to resolve.

Folks,



For the record, I recognize that you are trying to staff multiple accounts with multiple projects.



However, as Henry has mentioned, we are on the cusp of breaking into a client who has a very strong CTS and Tata partnerships.



We have worked extremely hard to get DataTech engaged in an offshore model which I can assure you has NOT been easy.   If we want any chance to expand this presence, we have to create the very best 1st impression of our offshoring capabilities as possible.   Our team went through an extensive interview process and selected the candidates a month ago.    Switching out a resource at the last second for a potentially lesser skilled resource is not acceptable. 



Any candidate that we replace needs to be done ASAP and we need candidates of equal or better skills.   So, if we have to replace Sriram, we need backfill candidates presented NOW.

Vivek,



I understand.  We are juggling a lot of demand.   However, we need to interview any person proposed for backfill and the visa ready status has to be considered.  I'll let my team know we need to search for a replacement.  We are looking for very strong positions iin the beginning because these will be our leads in the future. 



kishor,



Can you get us some more resumes?  I'll also get my team to review notes for persons we have previously interviewed to see if we have a backup.

Henry / Chris,

    The decision on moving Sriram for the onsite role in TDBN are based on the following,

1.    Sriram wants to work in US else we have a possibility that he will quit at offshore.
1.     There are limited visa ready resources. In this scenario it is in the best interest of the company, account and the practice to maximize the use of visa ready associates for onsite roles to increase margin and bottomline.
1. We have a backfill for Sriram and kishor will be working to bring the backfill person upto speed.
Above all we have kishor working very closely  with the GoldBank team providing delivery oversight and working on building a good offshore team for GoldBank.

We discussed all the possible combinations before arriving at the decision on using Sriram at TDBN. If still there are any questions or concerns from a practice perspective regarding offshore or visa ready associate, kindly set up a call with the team in this mail and we can resolve it.

Regards,

All,





We already have materials in these guys hands and Upendra is coordinating with them on their schedule - early and late here.   We'll not plan on stopping progress unless someone tells us this resource will be taken from us.   We do not have the time to waste.   On the other hand, if we are to have a person taken, the sooner the better so that we can regroup.

kishor,



It runs much deeper than the knowledge transfer.   We've already worked through client, established userid and requested access.   This is GoldBank first encounter with Cap off shore.   Is this the first impression we want to give?  I do not want to go to Susan and tell her that our first attempt at off shore staffing already has a hiccup.   



This call will obviously come from elsewhere though.  We'll make the best of it.

Crish, Henry,



Sam has already mentioned this, but let me reiterate:



Out of 4 GoldBank positions, 3 names are remaining unchanged. There is only 1 change. If I am not wrong, team has spent about 6-8 hours on knowledge transition.



Entire team (including I, Upendra and existing resources) will work to ensure new resource is upto speed in next 3 days and covers entire knolwedge transition. If this means working over week end, we can do it.



Thanks,

Thanks for trying to work out this deal, given the staffing chWhiteges.  Unless Henry has a concern about losing Sriram, Im ok. The net effect is we have 5 new roles for which to bill.

Chris and Henry,



I just got off the call with our offshore team.  All 5 positions will be covered for GoldBank with a commitment from the entire practice, including kishor and Vivek Singh in leadership to be sure that one (1) Gbank backfill, that is needed, is completely onboarded and ready to go.



TDBN will not get fully staffed as a result, but we did shift one resource out of the GoldBank pool: Sriram Chokkalingam.



We did this because Sriram has a Visa, would work for one of the open TDB positions, and very much wants to work in the U.S.  We also can easily backfill in offshore for this position as described below. See a cut/paste of kishor's note below to see how the backfill is being arranged.



Please call me or let me know if this causes any major concern.



Regards,



Sam

We definitely want to work with Henry and perfectly understand that if we want to succeed at GoldBank, it has to be a join effort with Henry. I can also understand his replies to mails might be because he not having a continuous access to DataTech mails (I have been through this when I was at FirstBank!).



This was a classic operations research problem where we had 11 resources and 11 positions to fill and we did our best to arrive at what we think is best solution. Important message that definitely needs to be conveyed to all participants is that offshore team wants all 3 accounts to succeed and there is absolutely no bias for / against any account.



This also is a big lesson for us in terms of understanding how future resource needs look like. We are immediately stepping up Informatica COE activities like what we did for SAS. One thing I can assure is in next 2 months, we will have a good pool of senior Informatica resources. We will achieve this by cross training senior data stage / Ab Initio / other BI skilled resources and also by other means like certifications, hiring etc. In fact, we are starting a large Informatica 8.5 competency building initiative tomorrow which will be lead by Somnath More who has great Infa experience.

He's fine and you shouldn't worry about him too much. I spoke to him this morning and he agreed to drop it (I'm about ready to drop him).  Thanks for your professionalism and patience.  I do want to work with Henry and not against him.  Unfortunately, it requires you to put up with a lot of nonsense, but I think it will be worth it, if you keep trying.

Sam,



As you have said, we are explaining it may be 4th time that we are proposing a resource who was already interviewed and selected.

Can you please talk to Chris about it?



I am at a client site and may not get time today to call him.

Chris, Henry,



As I have mentioned earlier and Sam has also mentioned, we are proposing just one resource change. i.e.  Abha Bhende getting added to the team.

She has 7 years experience (as compared to 3 years for Sriram Chokkalingam) and has extensive experience in testing.

She has already been interviewed by Praveen for testing position and he had liked her profile (please see enclosed mail). Only reason of not considering her originally was that she did not have visa and Praveen wanted her to travel within 3-4 days.

However, we can get a business visa for her and she can travel within 10 days.



Thus, I dont think we are proposing a new candidate.

In short, new team will look like this:



Development:

X       Narendra Prajapati (has visa, was interviewed by Adam and Beth. He moves from testing to development)

X       Veeranjaneyulu Boppudi (was interviewed by Adam and Beth. No change)



Testing:

X       Sandhya Jampala (was interviewed by Praveen. No change)

X       Abha Bhende (was interviewed by Praveen. We can get her business visa in 10 days. She being senior of the 2 testers, will travel onsite for short duration)

Chris,



This will be my 3rd e-mail to explain the decision made.  Please call me directly.



We are talking about one (1) change and we would lose this resource anyway, because he will soon quit unless he gets a US-based engagement. Another resource has been recommended and Henry and team wants to interview this candidate and wants other highly qualified candidates.  I'm sure that kishor and Vivek will do the best they can, but we simply don't have enough resources and we had to triage.  There has to be some compromise.  Neither Compass or TDBN has complete coverage and everyone is working hard to resolve.



Thanks,



Sam

Folks,



For the record, I recognize that you are trying to staff multiple accounts with multiple projects.



However, as Henry has mentioned, we are on the cusp of breaking into a client who has a very strong CTS and Tata partnerships.



We have worked extremely hard to get DataTech engaged in an offshore model which I can assure you has NOT been easy.   If we want any chance to expand this presence, we have to create the very best 1st impression of our offshoring capabilities as possible.   Our team went through an extensive interview process and selected the candidates a month ago.    Switching out a resource at the last second for a potentially lesser skilled resource is not acceptable. 



Any candidate that we replace needs to be done ASAP and we need candidates of equal or better skills.   So, if we have to replace Sriram, we need backfill candidates presented NOW.

Vivek,



I understand.  We are juggling a lot of demand.   However, we need to interview any person proposed for backfill and the visa ready status has to be considered.  I'll let my team know we need to search for a replacement.  We are looking for very strong positions iin the beginning because these will be our leads in the future.

Can you get us some more resumes?  I'll also get my team to review notes for persons we have previously interviewed to see if we have a backup.

Henry / Chris,

    The decision on moving Sriram for the onsite role in TDBN are based on the following,

1.    Sriram wants to work in US else we have a possibility that he will quit at offshore.
1.     There are limited visa ready resources. In this scenario it is in the best interest of the company, account and the practice to maximize the use of visa ready associates for onsite roles to increase margin and bottomline.
1. We have a backfill for Sriram and kishor will be working to bring the backfill person upto speed.
Above all we have kishor working very closely  with the GoldBank team providing delivery oversight and working on building a good offshore team for GoldBank.

We discussed all the possible combinations before arriving at the decision on using Sriram at TDBN. If still there are any questions or concerns from a practice perspective regarding offshore or visa ready associate, kindly set up a call with the team in this mail and we can resolve it.

1. Original plan was to get Narendra Prajapati to onsite for this requirement. He has a H1 visa which needs to be transferred (like what we did for Parag Pingle). This will anyway take at least 8-10 days from now. Thus Abha can travel same time as Narendra.
2. Currently there are about 12 open onsite positions for similar (Informatica, SQL) skills. We are not able to fill 3-4 of them because of non availability of visa ready resources. So we can continue search, but I can not assure if we can get any more such candidates.

Chris, Henry,



As I have mentioned earlier and Sam has also mentioned, we are proposing just one resource change. i.e.  Abha Bhende getting added to the team.

She has 7 years experience (as compared to 3 years for Sriram Chokkalingam) and has extensive experience in testing.

She has already been interviewed by Praveen for testing position and he had liked her profile (please see enclosed mail). Only reason of not considering her originally was that she did not have visa and Praveen wanted her to travel within 3-4 days.

However, we can get a business visa for her and she can travel within 10 days.



Thus, I dont think we are proposing a new candidate.

In short, new team will look like this:



Development:

X       Narendra Prajapati (has visa, was interviewed by Adam and Beth. He moves from testing to development)

X       Veeranjaneyulu Boppudi (was interviewed by Adam and Beth. No change)



Testing:

X       Sandhya Jampala (was interviewed by Praveen. No change)

X       Abha Bhende (was interviewed by Praveen. We can get her business visa in 10 days. She being senior of the 2 testers, will travel onsite for short duration)

This will be my 3rd e-mail to explain the decision made.  Please call me directly.



We are talking about one (1) change and we would lose this resource anyway, because he will soon quit unless he gets a US-based engagement. Another resource has been recommended and Henry and team wants to interview this candidate and wants other highly qualified candidates.  I'm sure that kishor and Vivek will do the best they can, but we simply don't have enough resources and we had to triage.  There has to be some compromise.  Neither Compass or TDBN has complete coverage and everyone is working hard to resolve.



Thanks,



Sam

Folks,



For the record, I recognize that you are trying to staff multiple accounts with multiple projects.



However, as Henry has mentioned, we are on the cusp of breaking into a client who has a very strong CTS and Tata partnerships.



We have worked extremely hard to get DataTech engaged in an offshore model which I can assure you has NOT been easy.   If we want any chance to expand this presence, we have to create the very best 1st impression of our offshoring capabilities as possible.   Our team went through an extensive interview process and selected the candidates a month ago.    Switching out a resource at the last second for a potentially lesser skilled resource is not acceptable. 



Any candidate that we replace needs to be done ASAP and we need candidates of equal or better skills.   So, if we have to replace Sriram, we need backfill candidates presented NOW.

Vivek,



I understand.  We are juggling a lot of demand.   However, we need to interview any person proposed for backfill and the visa ready status has to be considered.  I'll let my team know we need to search for a replacement.  We are looking for very strong positions iin the beginning because these will be our leads in the future. 



kishor,



Can you get us some more resumes?  I'll also get my team to review notes for persons we have previously interviewed to see if we have a backup.

Henry / Chris,

    The decision on moving Sriram for the onsite role in TDBN are based on the following,

1.    Sriram wants to work in US else we have a possibility that he will quit at offshore.
1.     There are limited visa ready resources. In this scenario it is in the best interest of the company, account and the practice to maximize the use of visa ready associates for onsite roles to increase margin and bottomline.
1. We have a backfill for Sriram and kishor will be working to bring the backfill person upto speed.
Above all we have kishor working very closely  with the GoldBank team providing delivery oversight and working on building a good offshore team for GoldBank.

We discussed all the possible combinations before arriving at the decision on using Sriram at TDBN. If still there are any questions or concerns from a practice perspective regarding offshore or visa ready associate, kindly set up a call with the team in this mail and we can resolve it.

Regards,

Vivek Singh

All,





We already have materials in these guys hands and Upendra is coordinating with them on their schedule - early and late here.   We'll not plan on stopping progress unless someone tells us this resource will be taken from us.   We do not have the time to waste.   On the other hand, if we are to have a person taken, the sooner the better so that we can regroup.

kishor,



It runs much deeper than the knowledge transfer.   We've already worked through client, established userid and requested access.   This is GoldBank first encounter with Cap off shore.   Is this the first impression we want to give?  I do not want to go to Susan and tell her that our first attempt at off shore staffing already has a hiccup.   



This call will obviously come from elsewhere though.  We'll make the best of it.

Crish, Henry,



Sam has already mentioned this, but let me reiterate:



Out of 4 GoldBank positions, 3 names are remaining unchanged. There is only 1 change. If I am not wrong, team has spent about 6-8 hours on knowledge transition.



Entire team (including I, Upendra and existing resources) will work to ensure new resource is upto speed in next 3 days and covers entire knolwedge transition. If this means working over week end, we can do it.

Chris and Henry,



I just got off the call with our offshore team.  All 5 positions will be covered for GoldBank with a commitment from the entire practice, including kishor and Vivek Singh in leadership to be sure that one (1) Gbank backfill, that is needed, is completely onboarded and ready to go.



TDBN will not get fully staffed as a result, but we did shift one resource out of the GoldBank pool: Sriram Chokkalingam.



We did this because Sriram has a Visa, would work for one of the open TDB positions, and very much wants to work in the U.S.  We also can easily backfill in offshore for this position as described below. See a cut/paste of kishor's note below to see how the backfill is being arranged.



Please call me or let me know if this causes any major concern.



Regards,



Sam

Testing:

1.      Abha Bhende -- added to testing group. (Onsite and then offshore - We can process B1 visa for her and get her onsite for 3-4 weeks. She was interviewed by Praveen and selected.

This leaves us with no option, but to have Sriram Chokkalingam allocated to GoldBank as per original plan.



We will still have Brij Ganesh travel to TDBN over this week end. Howard and Tom have interviewed Vasu Dev Koti and have kept him on hold. Also they have interviewed one more local candidate suggested by Jaideep. Thus we have potential of filling all 3 TDBN positions.

kishor,



See notes from Beth below.   Narendra was one of their lowest rated individuals for Informatica skills.   We will not be moving him to the developer role. 



That leaves us down one developer and we are looking for lead quality.   We have not seen this person so far, so we are hoping for a new batch of candidates.  



Praveen,



Since Narendra is still a testing candidate, does this mean tha you would like to stick with your original two testers:   Narendra and Sandhya?  Or do you want to consider this potential third choice -  Abha.   We have userids in process for the first two and Susan has their names.   But if the other candidate (Abha)  is a lot stronger we can discuss raising another change to Susan.

kishor,



No need for the underlined font.   We can understand you:)   You are mentioning one name change as you confirmed, in addition to some role changes.   Plus there's a domino effect.   Let's put this to the team. 





Beth, Praveen, Upendra



1) We have lost Sriram due to GoldBank hiccup last week. 



2)  kishor suggests below that Narendra moves from tester role to developer.   That sounds like something that needs to be confirmed.   What do you think?  Beth, this is mainly your call.  Please respond.   If you need another interview to determine, please request.   I would couple it with others.      

No - Narendra actually has one of our lowest rated scores for Informatica development. I would rather get someone else to interview.   He was slated as a tester because his skills were good enough for that role and his communication was pretty good.



3) Since Sriram was considered to be our senior guy, and had visa, it was perfect to bring him here for initiation.  1) Beth / Upendra - Are either of the guys below (including the morphed tester) qualified to be our lead developer?   kishor - do either have a visa?   If no for either, we need to be searching diligently for our lead again.  We have to get this role up to speed ASAP because development begins next week.    Being that we only have two slots approved now, if we need to be searching for lead, one of these developers may be released after we find our lead.     

No  for Narendra - See comments above.    Veera we agreed was strong with his tech skills but communication was very low.  As a lead we need someone with both, as well as someone who has almost some Informatica config experience (almost some Admin type exposure) 



4) Praveen is dealing with the tester role separately.   However, keep in mind Praveen that if the proposed role switch from tester to developer is not satisfactory for the development team or if we don't have a lead or a visa, then this person is still potentially our tester.   Hopfully we can answer these questions immediately.    



Finally,  we have another turnover  today.   Imran is immediately returning to India for an illness in the family.   Staffing has been one of the sore spots at this client and our offshore is getting off to a rocky start.   Let's all do the best we can here.   



Thanks,

Chris, Henry,



As I have mentioned earlier and Sam has also mentioned, we are proposing just one resource change. i.e.  Abha Bhende getting added to the team.

She has 7 years experience (as compared to 3 years for Sriram Chokkalingam) and has extensive experience in testing.

She has already been interviewed by Praveen for testing position and he had liked her profile (please see enclosed mail). Only reason of not considering her originally was that she did not have visa and Praveen wanted her to travel within 3-4 days.

However, we can get a business visa for her and she can travel within 10 days.



Thus, I dont think we are proposing a new candidate.

In short, new team will look like this:



Development:

X       Narendra Prajapati (has visa, was interviewed by Adam and Beth. He moves from testing to development)

X       Veeranjaneyulu Boppudi (was interviewed by Adam and Beth. No change)



Testing:

X       Sandhya Jampala (was interviewed by Praveen. No change)

X       Abha Bhende (was interviewed by Praveen. We can get her business visa in 10 days. She being senior of the 2 testers, will travel onsite for short duration)





Thanks,

For now it seems to be resolved. In a nutshell following are details in chronological order:

1. Henry and his team had interviewed 7-8 associates for GoldBank and shortlisted 4. However, 2 weeks back they came back saying client does not want offshore.
2. Hence we projected these associates for TDBN & Compass.
3. In the mean time, Henry came back saying client has given go ahead for offshore.
4. We gave back all associates to GoldBank except Sriram Chokkalingam. Reason was Sriram had L1. TDBN requirement is onsite and GoldBank requirement is offshore. Hence Sriram going for TDBN makes sense. Also he is aspiring for onsite. As a replacement we suggested couple of options to Henry.
5. Henry and Chris kept on resisting this saying that they have spent time on knowledge sharing with offshore (which was 1 hour a day session conducted by Upendra for a week) and they will not release Sriram.
6. To resolve all this, I scheduled a call between all 3 accounts, Sam, Vivek and me. Except Henry and Chris everyone attended. All agreed on our plan and Sam gave go ahead.
7. However, Henry and Chris still kept on arguing that they are not completely OK with releasing Sriram.
8. Because I went back to Henry for discussing this, Sam felt I am overriding his decision (his decision was infact a solution designed by us. So why would I override my own solution?)

However, I have talked to Sam and clarified everything. Looks like he is convinced that nobody is overriding his decision.

Big problem here as mentioned by Vivek is our GoldBank team was not in agreement with the decision initially and they kept on expressing that with me. I also got some not so good mails which I did not respond.

In short, let us not take this forward as getting work done is more important than anything else.

I think there is a clear lack of 'one team concept' from few sides here which is such a core value that we have been following and it is really harming the growth. I can conclude it from few comments I have heard. It has also affected CCRM project a lot. Check with Santosh! 
I have copied Santosh just because he was involved in few discussions where we got to know about discussions that really harm our cause and also he can tell about impact on CCRM.

But just to preserve this one team concept, let us not get into arguments, but try to resolve issues patiently.

Thanks,

Sam,


I think we are all on the same page and it's just a question of clearing the misunderstanding.


Henry and Chris did not attend the call with all 3 accounts to finalize allocations. Hence I had scheduled a separate call with Jaideep, Henry, Chris and you to convey the allocations.

In that call Chris and Henry said that they will first interview the replacement and then only release Sriram. We also agreed to schedule interview of replacement on Monday.

Thus, we are still following your decision of allocating Sriram to TDBN after replacement is decided.

Please schedule interview with Sandhya either on Monday after 11 or Tuesday morning.    Adam and Beth will be conducting.   Being that we have three more openings, let's stack up as many as you can...

Henry,



One more suggestion:



Can we move Sandhya Jampala to development in place of Sriram? She has good Informatica experience. Beth and Adam can interview her. She will be replaced by another developer in testing. Thus, the team will look like this:



Development: Sandhya Jampala, Veeranjaneyulu Boppudi

Testing: Narendra Prajapati, Abha Bhende



Upendra, Praveen, what are your thoughts on this?

kishor,



See notes from Beth below.   Narendra was one of their lowest rated individuals for Informatica skills.   We will not be moving him to the developer role. 



That leaves us down one developer and we are looking for lead quality.   We have not seen this person so far, so we are hoping for a new batch of candidates.  



Praveen,



Since Narendra is still a testing candidate, does this mean tha you would like to stick with your original two testers:   Narendra and Sandhya?  Or do you want to consider this potential third choice -  Abha.   We have userids in process for the first two and Susan has their names.   But if the other candidate (Abha)  is a lot stronger we can discuss raising another change to Susan.

kishor,



No need for the underlined font.   We can understand you:)   You are mentioning one name change as you confirmed, in addition to some role changes.   Plus there's a domino effect.   Let's put this to the team. 





Beth, Praveen, Upendra



1) We have lost Sriram due to GoldBank hiccup last week. 



2)  kishor suggests below that Narendra moves from tester role to developer.   That sounds like something that needs to be confirmed.   What do you think?  Beth, this is mainly your call.  Please respond.   If you need another interview to determine, please request.   I would couple it with others.      

No - Narendra actually has one of our lowest rated scores for Informatica development. I would rather get someone else to interview.   He was slated as a tester because his skills were good enough for that role and his communication was pretty good.



3) Since Sriram was considered to be our senior guy, and had visa, it was perfect to bring him here for initiation.  1) Beth / Upendra - Are either of the guys below (including the morphed tester) qualified to be our lead developer?   kishor - do either have a visa?   If no for either, we need to be searching diligently for our lead again.  We have to get this role up to speed ASAP because development begins next week.    Being that we only have two slots approved now, if we need to be searching for lead, one of these developers may be released after we find our lead.     

No  for Narendra - See comments above.    Veera we agreed was strong with his tech skills but communication was very low.  As a lead we need someone with both, as well as someone who has almost some Informatica config experience (almost some Admin type exposure) 



4) Praveen is dealing with the tester role separately.   However, keep in mind Praveen that if the proposed role switch from tester to developer is not satisfactory for the development team or if we don't have a lead or a visa, then this person is still potentially our tester.   Hopfully we can answer these questions immediately.    



Finally,  we have another turnover  today.   Imran is immediately returning to India for an illness in the family.   Staffing has been one of the sore spots at this client and our offshore is getting off to a rocky start.   Let's all do the best we can here.   



Thanks,

Chris, Henry,



As I have mentioned earlier and Sam has also mentioned, we are proposing just one resource change. i.e.  Abha Bhende getting added to the team.

She has 7 years experience (as compared to 3 years for Sriram Chokkalingam) and has extensive experience in testing.

She has already been interviewed by Praveen for testing position and he had liked her profile (please see enclosed mail). Only reason of not considering her originally was that she did not have visa and Praveen wanted her to travel within 3-4 days.

However, we can get a business visa for her and she can travel within 10 days.



Thus, I dont think we are proposing a new candidate.

In short, new team will look like this:



Development:

Ø       Narendra Prajapati (has visa, was interviewed by Adam and Beth. He moves from testing to development)

Ø       Veeranjaneyulu Boppudi (was interviewed by Adam and Beth. No change)



Testing:

Ø       Sandhya Jampala (was interviewed by Praveen. No change)

Ø       Abha Bhende (was interviewed by Praveen. We can get her business visa in 10 days. She being senior of the 2 testers, will travel onsite for short duration)

Following is my reply:



1)     It seems that IT may be more interested in keeping the BDW in lock step with 171 if gaps are found.   I do not suspect that this kind of effort is accounted for

-        I think this effort needs to be accounted for in BDW.



2)     Agreement to use the USM has two impacts:

-        I can work with you to understand USM. I will schedule regular calls starting late this week. In the mean time, can you please send me USM model and any other documentation?

-        From your mail, looks like using USM may not be as easy as using any other staging area. In this case, do you recommend increasing effort for using USM? Should we add an effort for understanding USM for modeling USM for CCRM purpose?



3)     If the BDW is going to be kept in sync, then the USM -> BDW code will also need to be kept in sync.

-        This effort needs to be accounted for in BDW.



4)     There are further architectural issues that should be surfaced for consideration

-        Can you please let me know details of these issues so that we can discuss or if required make changes in our approach



5)     There are things in our 171 proposal that seem to be missing.   For instance, I see no reference to any systems containing \"dimensional\" type information. 

-        CCRM Data mart in our proposal is dimensional mart.



6)     I do not know the basis for the original estimates so I really can't make educated guesses on what adjustment might be needed. Plus we need to confirm exactly what GoldBank goals are with a potential new approach.  

-        Do we need to have call with GoldBank (CCRM & IT) to understand goals?

-        We had discussed estimates and project plan few weeks back. In addition, if you would like to know any specific estimate related details, please let me know



7)     They seem to want it to cost more money. Why fight it

-        Can you please check which areas of project (testing / mapping / development etc) are they looking for more increased effort? We can look into specific areas accordingly.

-        From your mail, looks like using USM may not be as easy as using any other staging area. In this case, do you recommend increasing effort for using USM? Should we add an effort for understanding USM for modeling USM for CCRM purpose?

Santosh, 



Based on what I am hearing, we may want to consider adjusting this bid.





1) It seems that IT may be more interested in keeping the BDW in lock step with 171 if gaps are found.   I do not suspect that this kind of effort is accounted for.



2) Agreement to use the USM has two impacts:



a) the USM is a very formal \"staging area\".   Someone(s) will need to learn it and the mappings will be a bit more interesting that a dedicated staging table.  I have suggested that someone on 171 team look at USM.

b) the USM will need ot be kept in sync with Gaps



3) If the BDW is going to be kept in sync, then the US -> BDW code will also need to be kept in sync.



4) There are further architectural issues that should be surfaced for consideration

For the 171 D, the table below is what we have provided them and I have added a column which is a 15% markup if we need to do a fixed bid on it. This would be a good number to work with if we need to do a fixed bid. Note the Phase II and III cannot be done on a fixed bid basis.

Guys,







Mike is working feverishly to combine 310 and 171D.  The upside for us is that they are talking about combining the project office for the projects and beginning 171D sooner.  They want a fixed price on 171D, Phase I, and want us to indicate our basic number tomorrow, if possible.







Mike is fairly flexible on the payment schedule for 310, but wants milestones tied to acceptance vs. a data on the calendar.







They are trying to produce a RAC powerpoint by Thursday at 12n for internal review and have a steering committee next Wednesday where he says Ken D and Will are going to co-present.

I talked to Upendra today for about an hour.



He has serious concerns.



1. He joined DataTech in 2006 as senior con. He had 8 years experience that time. Since then he has not been promoted. He is still senior con. He has taken this up with Sam and Sam is looking into it.
2. Upendra is having lot of chWhiteges with Henry Miller (who manages GoldBank team). Few examples:
	1. Henry was on vacation for a week and after he joined, Upendra was not feeling well and was working from home for a day. This is only 5th time in last year or so that Upendra was taking off or working from home. However, he was asked to be 100% dedicated for next few weeks.
	2. There have been cases where huge errors were pointed out in Upendras code. He was sent mails. But it turned out that the mapping was developed by some one else.
3. Upendra has processed his H1 and if things dont change, he might quit.


I asked him to talk to Sam, Tony and Chris Carroll.



Just keeping you in loop. If you can casually talk to Sam, it will be good.

See below.   Brad is the new corporate risk bi lead for Ken Daniels.  We worked with him at Compass and believe he will lead the CCRM project to success.  He needs the SAS code for train 1 and train 2 along with any business logic we have extracted.  He is a full time Gbank employee, so no restrictions.



Brad, have you spoken to Bill Starkey at Gbank?

Good talking to you this morning.  I know you are in the process of traveling right now, but when you get a chance, would you please ask someone from your group to send me the business logic (Train 1 and Train 2 SAS logic).  You may have mentioned that you guys have already built a list and if that is the case - please do share.  I have asked for the SAS code here, but not receiving a quick enough response.  I am planning to compile a list of what we know is needed today and making this a \"working list\" to build over time.

This mail from Santosh rightly summarizes what is happening at GoldBank.



Santosh and I have explained everything about CCRM to Henry, we have had multiple calls, have sent all documentation. Still there are so many questions being raised from our own team (not by client) that we might end in losing this opportunity as approach taken by our team might result in CCRM business losing interest in project.

Subject: GoldBank discussions on 171D



Guys,



I have had discussions with kishor and Sam on the project over the last couple of days and also seen the mails which Henry has sent.



My concerns are as follows:

1. The 171 team has made it abundantly clear on what the deliverables, inputs, outputs, components, assumptions, etc for the project are. I think at this point we have documentation which can fill a room. The questions which get are a reiteration of the same. At some point Henry needs to say that he is comfortable. At this point we have nothing to add or say to what we have already said, sent or done in some form or the other over the last THREE MONTHS.
2. If we keep questioning things we will fast loose faith with the client, IT and CCRM alike and may end up loosing the 171 project completely.
3. I am also not sure how the fixed bid proposal impacts the Aug15th RAC meeting? I am afraid that this discussion will derail that process and we may end up with nothing to show. Chris Please correct me if I am wrong.


I am sorry for this frustration, but I am not sure how we can make this successful if we constantly question the 171 project!



On another note, I, at this point can summarize my situation as follows:

He is very optimistic that GoldBank CCRM will start by 25th August. Hence I think we should let him know about this or let FSA know accordingly.

This is in a nutshell what is happening at GoldBank:

1. Couple of weeks back, GoldBank IT and Henry recommended that we should use 'USM' which is a staging layer designed by Henry for EDW as staging layer for CCRM. Since this was not in scope in our original engagement, we (Samit and I) have not studied it.

2. But we added 4 weeks effort to study this staging layer and asked Henry if he wants to increase this effort. He did not comment on that.

3. Looks like GoldBank IT is pressurizing CCRM to have Henry in CCRM team and have him lead the effort.

I think now Sam has to make a call if he wants to have Henry as architect or me. Looking at size of project, we definitely don't need 2 architects.

Let us talk about this.

Subject: RE: SOW Heads Up

All,

So as I suspected, IT has requested several 310 resources by name.   Susan told me about this this morning and I it appears that Mike and IT will insist on this as much as they can.   I notice that the note below comes from Ken himself.   Based on where 171 has evolved, I agree with this proposal for several reasons:

1) Even though kishor has expressed confidence in using the USM and modifying it, I do not share that confidence.  He has not even spoken with our data modeler which is the only resource that could give him sound advice on what would be involved in maintaining and using this model.   The learning curve for the BDW is too long for anyone to work from scratch to become productive in this short time frame for 171.    Keep in mind that the USM is not what needs to be modeled.  You have to model in the BDW and then in turn that flows down to the USM.    Mapping to the USM is a skill that has taken months for us to train folks over here.   kishor has not spoken with anyone involved in the mapping process so I fear that he does not know what he does not know.   If we do not fully leverage 310 resource in 171, I would see this as a major risk to the project.        

2) Praveen is loved by all and there is a comprehensive test plan.   IT is seeing the SOW as lacking in detail for testing.   If you compare 310 and 171, the content around testing is indeed much greater.   I believe this is a valid observation.    


For the most part,  I do not see the above as necessarily adding any resources.  If you look at the staffing plan in the 171 SOW, it is simply assigning names to some of the roles.  Based on titles, the rates may be a bit different and there may be some minor up tick.    Additional focus on testing; however, may bump up the cost.  

With the timing of September start on 171 and with 310 coding wrapping up at the end of August, it is possible that we can transition these resources from one project to the other and still achieve the goals - especially if we have off shore support. 


There are some other issues in Ken's note of significance that we should probably discuss also.

Subject: SOW Heads Up



Good Morning Guys,

We had a meeting with Mike O'Brien and his team yesterday and discussed several items regarding the SOW. I thought I'd give you a heads up so that you could be better prepared to address these issues tomorrow. Several of our issues relative to the SOW start on page three with the table there. Here are some of the main issues:

* We would like to make it clear that the deliverable regarding the \"Document of business rules used in LGRED\" is a business friendly requirements document that defines the transformations and not just a technical document for the ETL coders. The Gladstones are probably the best place to start on this. The outcome from this document will be fed into our data governance solution.
* As part of the above, we will need a gap analysis where the Gladstones are not accurate or fail to define a transformation.
* We need an updated view on the hardware configuration and its adequacy. At first I think there were some concerns in that area, but later you all indicated that our current environment would be adequate. We need confirmation of that prior to the engagement as we sometimes have relatively long lead times in getting new equipment ordered, installed and configured. This item is also in your assumptions, so we just need to put this issue to bed prior to the engagement.
* In the activity defined \"Design ETL architecture,\" we need to include \"in line with GoldBank standards.\"
* In testing and deploying, in addition to test strategy, test cases, etc. we also need documented test outcomes, including fails. We would also like to consider getting a test manager (the one we have been using on 310) in lieu of you all providing a Project Manager. We will have a project manager from our end that will manage the combined project plan, conduct meetings, etc., so we'd rather have a test manager than a PM. Also as part of the deliverable here, we need a documented test plan that both of us signoff on.
* We need to talk about actual deployment. That would be our responsibility, but we need to define what that coordination looks like.
* There is an assumption that the USM design and documentation will be made available to the Q-171D team. Cap own that deliverable, so basically you are dependent on yourself. We need to clarify that dependency.
* We need to change the start datewe were thinking September 8th assuming RAC approval on August 18th. That change impacts all other dates in document.
* In the deliverable table on page 4, in the Analysis & Design Phase, we'd like to have an Initial Schedule prior to the engagement beginning and then a detailed project plan that can be seamed with the larger complete project plan that we will develop and manage by the end of this Phase. We have also made a baselined schedule a deliverable for the second payment.
* As it relates to the Network discussion on page 5, we assume that the connectivity cost is in the T&E estimates. Also we assume you meant VDI and not VPN as that is what we are using today with Cap. Also, on the T&E estimates, we would assume a lower number considering that a large portion of the work will be done in India that would have no T&E associated with it. Is that correct?
* We need to confirm the SharePoint solution as that is not a standard we are using across all projects at the moment, but we will try to accommodate that as it is a good collaborative solution.
* On page 6 relative to roles, as stated before, we'd like to swap out the PM for a Test Manager. I think your PM's are more administrative in nature, anyway. We are assuming Santosh plays the CR SME, we would like to request Henry for the BI Architect Role considering his familiarity and his wife (Beth) as the ETL Lead. We would like to use our own DBA for the DBA role. There are a couple of reasons that make sense that we can talk about. We'd also like resumes and right of refusal on the rest of the team. Getting this team right is critical and getting this mart right is critical for future marts.
* On page 7, we need to adjust dates and years, but we also would like to adjust the percentages as follows: 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%, 20%, 20%, 10% and include the Baselined Schedule as another deliverable for the second payment for \"Reference Logical Data Model Accepted.\" We are also still discussing T&M versus fixed so this has not been finalized.
* We need to have some discussion regarding your \"end in mind\" relative to the two bullet points regarding the \"As Is\" document on page 10. This sort of looks like an opened in gotcha.
* On page 11, fifth bullet relative to data quality, we'd like to add that data quality here references source system DQ and would not remove responsibility for Cap ensuring other data quality components in the mart. Relative to DQ, we also need to discuss what we can do in the way of a Data Governance Lite for the mart since DG is not addressed at the enterprise level.
* We need to add to Cap responsibilities that Cap will abide by our Change Management Standards and this would then include that in the mart deliverable that we have Dev and Test environments structured in addition to the Production environment.
* We'd like to include some language that will replace language in the current document that mirrors our other statements of work with you all that address review and standards. This language is as follows:
* Deliverables for review will be provided by DataTech in an incremental fashion as they are ready as opposed to a single delivery of a much larger package at the end of a phase.  GoldBank representatives will be required to provide approvals and feedback constantly throughout this effort.  
* DataTech will abide by GoldBanks documentation standards provided we are provided with those standards in advance of deliverables being created.  This includes but is not limited to the following: Business Requirements Template, Source to Target Mapping Templates, Test Strategy/Plans and Test Cases. It is assumed that these standards are in place as of the date of this SOW. 
* DataTech will abide by GoldBanks Architectural, Modeling and ETL standards provided we are provided with those standards in advance of deliverables being created.  It is assumed that these standards are in place as of the date of this SOW. 


I'm sure we will have other issues to discuss, but I hope this will give us a place to start and help speed up the discussion. Look forward to seeing you all tomorrow. Thanks.

As we discussed, we need to make following changes to CCRM project plan and corresponding changes to SOW:

1. Add a placeholder for modeling USM. Henry will add details of effort required.

2. Add additional effort for creating 'Business requirement'. This will mean some addition to our mapping and CCRM code documentation effort as well as some effort from CCRM (Peter and Melaine)

3. Add onsite test manager. We had assumed this role will be played by our Onsite coordinator. But now to incorporate this, we need to add a role for Praveen.

4. Remove DBA from our estimate as GoldBank will provide DBA.

5. Keep Project Manager for first 2 months only.

6. Testing approach -
   a. If changes are made to existing CCRM code, make a copy of existing code before changes and use it for testing.
   b. If changes are made to Starkey code for adding new fields, add those fields in CCRM only in 2nd phase.

7. Use of HUB V/S Starkey extracts:
   a. If data exists in HUB & Starkey and data matches in these 2 sources: Use HUB as source for CCRM
   b. If data exists in HUB & Starkey and values do not match because of integrity issues in HUB: Use Starkey as source for CCRM
   c. If data exists in HUB & Starkey and values do not match because of additional business rules in Starkey code: Decide where these rules should be applied. Ideally it should be in CCRM code.

8. Overall, total duration will exceed 7 months because of points 1 and 2 above.

Can you please discuss this with Sam and let me know if I can make changes to project plan?

Also, we need to pass the project plan to SFDC for estimating cost again as the changes are major and original project plan is drastically different than current version.

All,



To Dos from todays meeting:

1. Sam is updating the SOW
2. kishor and I are working on the changes to the project plan.
3. CHRIS: We need to pass the project plan to SFDC for estimating cost again as the changes are major and original project plan is drastically different than current version.
4. Henry will be providing project inputs to the USM design update part of the 171 project.




Based on our discussions kishor and I talked tonight on what the changes are to the project plan and the costs. The following are the changes we are making:





1. Add a placeholder for modeling USM. Based on the information there are 12 LOBs with a total of 700 variables which need to be mapped to the USM. Of these, based on Mikes and Susans comments, about 95% are covered in the USM design currently. The remaining 5% or 35 variables need to be added to the USM design. As an additional effort, to validate these assumptions, kishor is over the weekend, going to map one LOB into the USM to verify if this is indeed true.

Based on the email flow and discussions, we would like Henry to lead the effort in the 171 project to maintain the USM. We would like to discuss this option with you all.

In the interim, given these assumptions, we will need an estimate from Henry on:

	1. How long will he need to add these to the USM
	2. What are the resources including himself he will need for this activity so that we can add this to the project plan


 2. Add additional effort for creating 'Business requirement'. This will mean some addition to our mapping and CCRM code documentation effort as well as some effort from CCRM (Peter and Melaine)



3. Add onsite test manager. We had assumed this role will be played by our Onsite coordinator. But now to incorporate this, we need to add a role for Praveen.



4. Remove DBA from our estimate as GoldBank will provide DBA.



5. Keep Project Manager for first 2 months only.



6. Testing approach -

   a. If changes are made to existing CCRM code, make a copy of existing code before changes and use it for testing.

   b. If changes are made to Starkey code for adding new fields, add those fields in CCRM only in 2nd phase.



7. Use of HUB V/S Starkey extracts:

   a. If data exists in HUB & Starkey and data matches in these 2 sources: Use HUB as source for CCRM

   b. If data exists in HUB & Starkey and values do not match because of integrity issues in HUB: Use Starkey as source for CCRM

   c. If data exists in HUB & Starkey and values do not match because of additional business rules in Starkey code: Decide where these rules should be applied. Ideally it should be in CCRM code.



8. Overall, total duration will exceed 7 months because of points 1 and 2 above.



9. Since the complexity and controls have increased significantly, we are planning to add more of Santoshs time to the project.



kishor will send revised project plan by tomorrow EOD.

Chris,



Can you take, as an action, to determine if the following SOW statement is true given GoldBank current plan to use \"VPI\" or whatever the new connection protocol is at Gbank:



\"Network costs are estimated to include a one-time set-up charge of $1,000 and $350 per month for a site-to-site, VPN between GoldBank and DataTechs facilities in India.\"



I will not be able to resolve and this will come up again and prevent the SOW from being executed.  I'm releasing a draft of revisions in a few minutes.

3. Reduced loading of DBA to 0. Also loading for PM is only for first 2 months. This is because these roles will be filed by GoldBank.


Santosh, Chris,

I can participate in a walkthrough of this plan in next 1 hour or after 11:15 EST today.



Thanks,

Chris,



Attached is the project plan. I would like to walk you through this so that you can price it in SFDC.



1. There are two architectural roles defined here. The first architect is kishor who will manage the development of code from HUB to USM and from USM to Mart.
2. The second architect is Henry who will receive the analysis of fields from 171 and will modify the USM to accommodate the fields. As mentioned earlier, there are about 35 fields (based on what Mike and Susan) have indicated. The effort for this is four weeks. Henry needs to indicate if this is sufficient and also if he needs any resources to do the modeling.
3. Praveen has been added as the lead tester.
4. I have increased my time for the project to accommodate the IT checks and balances.


Please let me know what a convenient time will be to do this. Also, if kishor is available we can do this in the night (though for some reason he seems to have not slept)



Regards

Santosh

Guys,



I\"m going through this hurriedly and have tried to capture the revisions.  Please compare my edits to the list from Keith Martin and to your own notes.  Please add the project plan appendix and we need a sample \"Business Requirements Document.\"



I suggest that Santosh takes a pass this afternoon and passes to kishor for a clean-up for the next ship.  Chris and kishor can \"own the document\" and manage the master copy from here.



I'm available via cell this afternoon, but won't have access to a laptop.



Regards,



Sam

Can you please review minutes of meeting for today's call to discuss offshore connectivity setup?

If you are OK with this, please forward to GoldBank team as I do not have all email IDs





Minutes of meeting of conference call to discuss connectivity options for DataTech offshore team:



1. Following connectivity method was agreed:

    For connecting to GoldBank network from offshore: A thin client based method to be used to connect to GoldBank network. A user ID and password to be used for authentication for this thin client based connectivity. Currently GoldBank has about 450 offshore resources connecting to using this method.



    Once logged into GoldBank network: Once logged into GoldBank network, \"VDI\" method to be used to access a remote desktop in GoldBank network. This might be either a pool of desktops for offshore team or a dedicated desktop for each resource. Usually GoldBank IT team requires 1 week to setup VDI infrastructure for a new resource.



2. Action items identified:

   a. Henry to give Susan the details of user ID and list of applications to be accessed by offshore team.

   b. Susan to fill out 'remote access requirement form'

   c. Susan to fill out audit form for getting VDI access.

I had a discussion with connectivity team here in Mumbai.



1. If we are using VDI connectivity, there is no cost involved as everything is over internet and we do not charge for internet connectivity.
2. However, if for using VDI, GoldBank insists for a special type of machine, we will need to procure that. Approximate cost for this is about $300 per desktop.


I dont think GoldBank asks for any special machine as GoldBank laptops are similar to DataTech laptops. So there may not be any cost in this case.



We will talk more about this in the weekly call.

One more thing which we missed out in the discussion; what would be the team size here? If it is going to be huge then we might think for dedicated link to client place. Secondly, in 2 options pls. mention around $500 instead of $300

We are going to get lot of questions on cost.

Revised price is 1.47 million without 15% buffer. If we add buffer, it will be about 1.75. This is almost 50% increase. We need to be prepared to answer this. This is mainly due to:

1. Test manager added  200000 addition.
2. Business documentation added in scope  12000 addition
3. Added complexity of USM and review with GoldBank Architect


My gut feel is that this is slightly higher than their appetite. We will have to look for ways to cut cost.

Also, you need to have informal conversion with Keith and find out CCRM appetite.

Just now we had a call with Tony, Chris to discuss revised GoldBank proposal.

With changed requirements, it is about 1.5 million project (phase 1).



At this point I feel this is slightly higher than their appetite and we may need to reduce it a bit. But we have few buffers which we can cut.



Staffing  Chris is creation reqs. Minal / Yashita might have to schedule recurring weekly calls to discuss staffing. Start date is 8th September. Initially, we will need to staff:

Onsite:

1. Q171 Architect  kishor
2. ONC  Upendra Dharmavarapu
3. ETL Architect  We must have some one like Vishal Desai / Narendra Chincholikar
4. SME - Santosh
5. 2 Onsite BAs  Sandesh and one more which I feel should be Debtosh considering his SAS skills.
6. Project Manager  Sam has hired some one in US. But if we have an alternative, we can suggest.


Offshore:

1. 3 Business Analysts with SAS skills
2. 1 SQL developer


By November end, offshore team will get ramped up to 10 Informatica + 4 testers.

We discussed couple of points that we would like to attention of everyone:



1. ETL Lead and Onsite coordinator  Upendra can play the role of Onsite coordinator. However, we have offshore team of 10 developers and for a team of this size; ideally we would need 1.5 to 2 onsite coordinators. Hence, our original assumption was that along with Onsite coordinator, ETL lead will also work on coordination. Thus now, onsite coordination will be done by (Upendra + Beth) as per revised staffing plan.  
2. Project Analyst / Manager role: Now that we are close to $2 mm on fees + cost, can we implement following for project management?
	1. Santosh will be Project Lead / SME and will play the role of client face for DataTech for Q171. His role in addition to being SME will be to present status to GoldBank PM and be responsible for overall delivery.
	2. We will increase Santoshs time to 100% for first 2 months and then 50%.
	3. To assist Santosh in creating and maintaining project plan, creating status report etc, we will have an offshore project analyst.
	4. We will not have separate Project manager from DataTech.
We have implemented this kind of staffing successfully in FirstBank where there is an offshore PMO providing support to onsite leadership and onsite team is mainly responsible for delivery oversight.



1. This arrangement will result in bringing our fees down by $175000 (and further reduction in Travel cost as PM role is transferred to offshore)
2. To give more clarity to this, I have enclosed a document explaining roles and responsibilities of all the roles in the project. This table can be a part of the SOW.

Subject: 171 Project SOW



Henry and I talked this evening. The meeting was very positive and hopefully we can make this SOW work.



The key points were:

1. Henry and Beth are available to roll into the 171 project in September. (He will work with IT and make this happen)
2. Beth will fill in the position of the ELT Lead. We had slotted Upendra for this role at $140 per hour. Using Beth this cost will increase and the change needs to be reflected in the pricing sheet.
	1. kishor: can Upendra be the onsite coordinator?
3. The 310 Architect role was slotted for the first 4-6 weeks. Henry will fill up this role. This role will ensure that all the architecture conforms to GoldBanks overall strategy especially the BDW. This role needs to be extended till the end of the design phase i.e. when the data model is delivered. We need to talk to GoldBank and see if IT can extend this role to the end of the project (beyond the design phase) from their budget.
	1. The 171 Architect will be kishor. His main focus will be to ensure that CCRM needs are fulfilled. Henry in the role of the 310 Architect will provide inputs for all architectural activities from an overall GoldBank perspective.
	2. In case of a difference in opinion between kishor and Henry
                                                               i.      If it is a HUB to USM issue then we will differ the Henry

                                                             ii.      If it is a CCRM model issue we will differ to kishor

                                                            iii.      If it is a CCRM model issue but related to the BDW then we will differ to Henry

                                                           iv.      I will be the mediator for these discussions. Hopefully we will not have many of these.

1. The testing manager is Praveen


This ensures that all three people from the 310 project (Henry, Beth and Praveen are in the 171 project.)



The fees go up accordingly. Based on the spreadsheet, it is $2mm. ($1.6 fees, $0.24mm contingency, &0.16mm expenses). This is a far cry from the $1.2 mm that we started out with but then we are including here things which they want.



Chris: can you please use the current project plan attached to make the changes to the SOW?



Thanks

In these 2 points (1. Updation of Gladstone, 2. Data governance), we need to understand Keiths expectations correctly.




Point from Keith


DataTech action / change in SOW


We would like to make it clear that the deliverable regarding the \"Document of business rules used in LGRED\" is a business friendly requirements document that defines the transformations and not just a technical document for the ETL coders. The Gladstones are probably the best place to start on this. The outcome from this document will be fed into our data governance solution.


Do GoldBank IT and CCRM expect DataTech to update Gladstone documents? If yes, we need to add this to SOW as deliverable and also need to add resources in estimation. This needs to be discussed with Keith


We need to talk about actual deployment. That would be our responsibility, but we need to define what that coordination looks like.


I have added a paragraph (3rd bullet in 7.3) that discusses this.


As it relates to the Network discussion on page 5, we assume that the connectivity cost is in the T&E estimates. Also we assume you meant VDI and not VPN as that is what we are using today with Cap. Also, on the T&E estimates, we would assume a lower number considering that a large portion of the work will be done in India that would have no T&E associated with it. Is that correct?


Chris, can you confirm if we can take out the connectivity cost?


On page 11, fifth bullet relative to data quality, we'd like to add that data quality here references source system DQ and would not remove responsibility for Cap ensuring other data quality components in the mart. Relative to DQ, we also need to discuss what we can do in the way of a Data Governance Lite for the mart since DG is not addressed at the enterprise level.


We need to add a paragraph about Data Governance for CCRM. I could have added this section, but we need to understand Keiths expectations first. This needs to be discussed with Keith


We need to add to Cap responsibilities that Cap will abide by our Change Management Standards and this would then include that in the mart deliverable that we have Dev and Test environments structured in addition to the Production environment.


Added a point (4th bullet in section 7.2) for this.


We'd like to include some language that will replace language in the current document that mirrors our other statements of work with you all that address review and standards. This language is as follows:

* Deliverables for review will be provided by DataTech in an incremental fashion as they are ready as opposed to a single delivery of a much larger package at the end of a phase.  GoldBank representatives will be required to provide approvals and feedback constantly throughout this effort.  
* DataTech will abide by GoldBanks documentation standards provided we are provided with those standards in advance of deliverables being created.  This includes but is not limited to the following: Business Requirements Template, Source to Target Mapping Templates, Test Strategy/Plans and Test Cases. It is assumed that these standards are in place as of the date of this SOW. 
* DataTech will abide by GoldBanks Architectural, Modeling and ETL standards provided we are provided with those standards in advance of deliverables being created.  It is assumed that these standards are in place as of the date of this SOW. 

I have added a new section titled Standards to be followed during the project (Section 7.2). Santosh, Chris, can you please verify?



Thanks,

Subject: Revised SOW



Based on my notes, I have made some edits to the document Sam has provided.



Main changes:

1. Changes in the assumptions on data mapping etc which separates the steps on HUB to USM and USM to Mart.
2. Addition of the 310 Architect and the definition around activities between the 310 and 171 architect.
3. Addition of the baseline project plan
4. Refinement of the DataTech roles to match the project plan.
5. Project manager has been redefined as a project analyst support role.
6. Testing manager has been added.


kishor: Please see if you want to make any additional changes.



Chris: You will need to add the revised pricing to the SOW. Also, please look over the dates.



Chris / Henry: Please modify the 310 Architecture role as you see fit. Let us have a discussion on how we are going to present this, given that Henry and Beth will not be available full time for this project in September. I know you were working on this problem. Once you have resolved it, I would appreciate you making the appropriate changes to the plan and SOW and communicating to us what these changes are. We can discuss this on Monday morning too. I will be in Capmark, but can schedule some time for this.



Henry: please feel free to reach out to me over the weekend if you need to discuss this.



Regards

We discussed couple of points that we would like to attention of everyone:


1. ETL Lead and Onsite coordinator  Upendra can play the role of Onsite coordinator. However, we have offshore team of 10 developers and for a team of this size; ideally we would need 1.5 to 2 onsite coordinators. Hence, our original assumption was that along with Onsite coordinator, ETL lead will also work on coordination. Thus now, onsite coordination will be done by (Upendra + Beth) as per revised staffing plan.  
2. Project Analyst / Manager role: Now that we are close to $2 mm on fees + cost, can we implement following for project management?
	1. Santosh will be Project Lead / SME and will play the role of client face for DataTech for Q171. His role in addition to being SME will be to present status to GoldBank PM and be responsible for overall delivery.
	2. We will increase Santoshs time to 100% for first 2 months and then 50%.
	3. To assist Santosh in creating and maintaining project plan, creating status report etc, we will have an offshore project analyst.
	4. We will not have separate Project manager from DataTech.
We have implemented this kind of staffing successfully in FirstBank where there is an offshore PMO providing support to onsite leadership and onsite team is mainly responsible for delivery oversight.



1. This arrangement will result in bringing our fees down by $175000 (and further reduction in Travel cost as PM role is transferred to offshore)
2. To give more clarity to this, I have enclosed a document explaining roles and responsibilities of all the roles in the project. This table can be a part of the SOW.
3. Chris, I have enclosed revised resource loading document. It has 2 options. One with all the changes that I have mentioned above and one without the changes.

Subject: 171 Project SOW



Henry and I talked this evening. The meeting was very positive and hopefully we can make this SOW work.



The key points were:

1. Henry and Beth are available to roll into the 171 project in September. (He will work with IT and make this happen)
2. Beth will fill in the position of the ELT Lead. We had slotted Upendra for this role at $140 per hour. Using Beth this cost will increase and the change needs to be reflected in the pricing sheet.
	1. kishor: can Upendra be the onsite coordinator?
3. The 310 Architect role was slotted for the first 4-6 weeks. Henry will fill up this role. This role will ensure that all the architecture conforms to GoldBanks overall strategy especially the BDW. This role needs to be extended till the end of the design phase i.e. when the data model is delivered. We need to talk to GoldBank and see if IT can extend this role to the end of the project (beyond the design phase) from their budget.
	1. The 171 Architect will be kishor. His main focus will be to ensure that CCRM needs are fulfilled. Henry in the role of the 310 Architect will provide inputs for all architectural activities from an overall GoldBank perspective.
	2. In case of a difference in opinion between kishor and Henry
                                                               i.      If it is a HUB to USM issue then we will differ the Henry

                                                             ii.      If it is a CCRM model issue we will differ to kishor

                                                            iii.      If it is a CCRM model issue but related to the BDW then we will differ to Henry

                                                           iv.      I will be the mediator for these discussions. Hopefully we will not have many of these.

1. The testing manager is Praveen


This ensures that all three people from the 310 project (Henry, Beth and Praveen are in the 171 project.)



The fees go up accordingly. Based on the spreadsheet, it is $2mm. ($1.6 fees, $0.24mm contingency, &0.16mm expenses). This is a far cry from the $1.2 mm that we started out with but then we are including here things which they want.



Chris: can you please use the current project plan attached to make the changes to the SOW?



Thanks

This is where CCRM stands today:



1. GoldBank asked for including Henry, Beth and Praveen in the team. We did this and added them to the staffing plan.
2. Now GoldBank has come back and is questioning me and Santosh being there on the project.


We all know where these comments are driven from!



Important thing is if this is not sorted by 15th August, GoldBank executive committee will not approve SOW in August and project start may be delayed to October.

This is fair feedback.  Weve been down this path several times with these guys.  We do need to address the overall cost. However, we also need to have a dialogue with Susan and Keith around the explanations of the price difference.  The expectation that we add more roles or that we simply add more expensive roles for the same cost as last week is simply not reasonable.  I dont believe that Keith or Susan are this unrealistic but we do need a chance to explain the differences and reasons for the changes.



Well be able to clarify most of these concerns tomorrow.

Gentlemen,

Keep in mind that I am the messenger here.  Although the feedback came from Susan, I am told that several from both the business and IT stayed in the room to discuss next steps.   There was a lot of feedback so I'm just trying to remember it all and present it objectively here.  Rest assured that I supported the DataTech team.



* A very prominent member of the Business team asked Susan if she thought CTS could do this.  
* Feedback is that this higher number is not going to get through committee - neither business or IT are going to try
* Keith did make the RFP comment during the meeting
* Supposedly there was discussion about the poor grammar and \"unprofessionally\" of the document
* There was much consternation that the suggested changes from the prior meeting were not accurately reflected in this version.   So much so that they are not even going to ask us to change it again.   They are going to make the changes themselves.
* As in the meeting, there was discussion about \"additional\" resources versus assigning persons to \"existing\" roles.  I stated that was a fair question and that I thought that Santosh would come back with the deltas and associated costs and perhaps some other options based on feedback from today.  
* \"DataTech should not feel confident that they have this\"
* A less prominent member of the Business questioned whether Santosh was needed for this first phase 1 which only involved data movement and re-engineering
* IT of course is not convinced that kishor is a critical part of the staffing model.
* There seems to be an epiphany happening in that phase 1 is not so complex with only a reverse engineering
* They do seem to value that we have a data mart model ready
* She was having trouble understanding the math.   Wasn't working out in her head and that was the consensus in the group.   Why was it so much more?. 


Again gentlemen, I am just forwarding the message.  Susan and I have a good relationship and she provides me with invaluable and timely feedback sometimes.  Fortunately, she realized that I was not going to say anything contrary to our official Cap approach and quit asking me questions.   She shared with me for 45 minutes though.

Subject: SOW changes and revised fees. (Please confirm receipt)



Keith,



As a follow-up to our meeting today, I have put together the change in costs from the last weeks numbers to this week and can go over them with you. However, I understand that this increase is substantial and will not be acceptable to GoldBank. ( I have added the reconciliation to the end of the mail)



It was unfortunate that I could not spend adequate time on the SOW and estimates given that I was busy with another client. I apologize for the inconvenience.



I have redesigned the plan and have made changes to it so that the revised numbers are in line with the previous estimates.



A comparison of the two is as follows:




Summary


With contingencies & exp


Just fees


New Proposal


$1,410,625


$1,150,280


Old Proposal


$1,344,515


$1,062,858


Difference


$66,110


$87,422


Percentage change


4.7%


7.6%



The main changes which were made were as follows:

1. In the original proposal, the Onsite Coordinator was to double up as the Testing manager. Here Praveen can do that too. We do not need a separate Testing Manager Position and this will keep us in line with the original estimates.
2. We have lowered the rates to compensate for the increased rates which we use for Beth and Praveen ($175 as opposed to the $140 which was in the original proposal)
3. My time increased marginally due to the additional items in the SOW. However, I have reduced my rate so that the change is not significant from an overall perspective.


The complete list of changes is as follows:





All numbers BELOW include cost and contingency.

In this solution we have thus accommodated Henry, Beth and Praveen as was directed by IT. The overall increase in costs is 5%. I am hoping that this will work.



We have kishor for the duration of the project. As I have indicated to you, his role is crucial for the success of the project as:

1.       He is intimately familiar with the CCRM process, code and data.

2.       He will be on-shore for the design phase of the project and will be off-shore directing the ETL development, thus reducing the delivery risk significantly. Additionally it drives down the cost of the project.

3.       For the duration of the design phase both Henry and kishor will be coordinating on the design thus ensuring that the CCRM mart is in sync with the USM and BDW design.



If there are any reservations to using kishor from GoldBank, I would like that to be indicated to us.



We will then have to consider using Henry full-time for the duration of the project. As of now he is on the design phase of the project only. This will increase the costs as he is on the on-shore rate.



I am available tomorrow any time but between 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM.  I will reach out to you during the day and we can go over these changes.





Chris too will be reaching out to you.



Regards

Santosh



PS:



For the sake of completeness, the reconciliation between last weeks estimates and the ones we proposed today are as given below. The main drivers for this increase were:

1. The addition of the testing manager  we have swapped this role in the revised proposal
2. The higher rates for Beth and Praveen
3. Adding Henry as the 310 architect.

I have submitted and resubmitted the staffing model at least 3 times.  Each was based upon an internal spreadsheet staffing model developed by Henry and some of the team members.  Im not sure why these sorts of requests continue to arise.  The staffing model in SFDC has included Henry and the rest of the team members listed below for a couple months now.

All right Chris, we are depending on you here.  I don't have access to this system.  Need to make sure everyone is covered and match the req numbers to the positions.   My list is below for on-shore.

 Based on your list below, we need reqs for all off shore positions also??    If so, I'll publish the list from resource plan and we will start matching and creating.

","2008-09-08 22:05:34""","kishor Vishnu Deshpande","[Aid4Mail Trial tag #293] Process documents","","Henry, Adam, Santosh,



We have following topics in OTG meeting tomorrow. I am just putting my thoughts on these topics:



1. Schedule of conference calls:
We need to have 2 types of calls:

	1.  Weekly call involving Henry, kishor, Santosh and Adam. You have already scheduled this call. We can invite Seema / Parag / Beth whenever required.
	2. Daily conference calls: It is very important that we have daily calls at least in the beginning of the project. The calls need to happen in the morning India time as whatever is discussed in the call affects days work for offshore team. Offshore team travels by DataTech transport facility and earliest offshore team can reach office is 8:45 AM IST. Hence suitable time for daily calls is 9 AM IST (10:30 PM EST after daylight saving and 11:30 PM EST for now). Participant in these calls should be Parag, Seema (since she has to coordinate with offshore BA) and offshore team including me. If any particular day Parag feels that answering a query will need Beths help, he will invite her for the call. Same is true about Seema. If she needs any help from Santosh, she will invite him for any particular day.


1. Review process:
We need to document review process and its results. This is true about reviews being done at offshore as well as any review that Parag / Beth might do. I am enclosing a DataTech review log template which we have been using for long. I am sure Parag must have used this for long too. He can explain it to you. I am fine with using any GoldBank template too but important is that review comments should not just remain in emails.



1. Query and issue log:
What I said about review (should not remain in mails only) is true about queries also. So we need to update Query issue log at least on weekly basis. This can be a joint responsibility of Parag and me.



1. Managing changes to requirements:
Documenting changes to requirements is of utmost importance (more than queries and review). I am enclosing a log that we have been using.

I was going through GoldBank ETL standards and found reference to GoldBank Informatica Mapping Development Specification Workbook and found that it has provision for tracking changes. I am fine with using this workbook as change tracking mechanism, but every change should be reflected in the workbook. I think this also relates to one of your agenda item of How we are going to define requirement.



In short, we are fine with using any mechanism for tracking and documenting (including using GoldBank templates), but we should define the process before we begin.

I have similar thoughts on testing, but we can discuss that later. I will go through any documentation that Praveen has and then will send my thoughts on testing.



Let us discuss these topics tomorrow.



Thanks,



kishor Deshpande

kishor,

I see that I did not respond to this.   If you look at the overall hours, the new plan should have at least as many hours allocated off shore if not more.   It is just spread over a longer period of time.   We still don't expect to do much development on-shore.

Henry,



One question about resource loading 

As per original plan, we had minimum of 6 and maximum of 10 ETL developers during entire development phase.

Now it is reduced to maximum of 6 developers. However, you have spread the allocation of developers over entire project. For example, during design phase also there will be 2 to 3 developers at offshore.



I hope this reduced developers allocation at offshore will be compensated by development work that will be done by Adam / Beth / Parag.



Let me know your thoughts.



Thanks,

Tony,



We are locked and loaded now.   Attached is resoruce spreadsheet.  



I know that kishor has said that he has a number of the off-shore resource lined up now also.   We'll be working on submitting those names shortly.  



Our contractural off-shore authorization and network access are the biggest issues now.   WIthout the auth. I can't get much movement on the technical side.

Subject: RE: GoldBank reqs



Im confused here.  I have submitted and resubmitted the staffing model at least 3 times.  Each was based upon an internal spreadsheet staffing model developed by Henry and some of the team members.  Im not sure why these sorts of requests continue to arise.  The staffing model in SFDC has included Henry and the rest of the team members listed below for a couple months now.



Perhaps, somebody can provide me some guidance as to why you guys are not receiving this information?

I talked to her and here is my feedback.



She has undergone Base SAS training and would brush up her SAS skills again before the project date. I explained her the kind of work that she would be expected to performed and what I got to know was she had already done similar work in her FDC project.



Regarding documentation skills, I have asked her to share few FDC documentations that she had created as part of the project. She doesnt have a problem or an issue in taking up this role, but she is more inclined towards the development role which I said, could be considered in later phases depending upon her performance in this role.



She has no issues on the personal front to be on the project for the mentioned duration.


But given all of the above statements, am not sure how she would really make justice to this role as we want a person with some risk management knowledge along with SAS skills. I had personally worked with her an year back and found her to be more interested to work on the coding /development part of the projects.



We can definitely try her out in this position and hope she can make a useful contribution. If we have other profile, we should explore those too



Thanks,

Sandesh,



Please rate her on basis of following:



1. SAS knowledge
2. Ability to paint big picture from code
3. Written communication
4. Willingness to be a BA
5. Commitment to be in project for next 8 months. Check if she has any issues on personal front.


Harish, the reason I have copied you on this mail is if you know some one from Morgan who wants to be a BA, we have a position.

kishor,

We will have Manaswini Mahajan for the BA role. I have asked her to meet Sandesh today. Once the 2 months BA assignment is over she wants to move to development which I believe should not be an issue as we have some developer positions open for Dec.

Sandesh, Minal, Yashita,



BA position in GoldBank starts on 6th October. We have 2 BA positions, one of which will be filled by Sandesh.



We need to identify 2nd BA as soon as possible. Reason being that we need to get him/her upto speed on type of work and if required on SAS (the BA will be required to understand SAS code).



Do you have any thoughts?

I am OK to accept anyone who has attitude and aim to be a BA. SAS skills can be taught. If we don't have any one in BI bench, we should explore following possibilities:



1. Check with Georgina / Sundaram if they have some one who wants to be a BA. Most of FirstBank associats have SAS skills.

2. Check with Shiv Ranjan if he has some one senior (like Abhijit Valsangkar / Parag Pingle). But if he has one, we need to do expectation setting correctly.

3. Check with any other BA group / banking group in CS. I am least inclined for this.



Ideal candidate should be at least Consultant level, but I am ok with junior associate too if Sandesh talks and finds the associate good.



Thanks,

Henry, Adam, Santosh,



We have following topics in OTG meeting tomorrow. I am just putting my thoughts on these topics:



1. Schedule of conference calls:
We need to have 2 types of calls:

	1.  Weekly call involving Henry, kishor, Santosh and Adam. You have already scheduled this call. We can invite Seema / Parag / Beth whenever required.
	2. Daily conference calls: It is very important that we have daily calls at least in the beginning of the project. The calls need to happen in the morning India time as whatever is discussed in the call affects days work for offshore team. Offshore team travels by DataTech transport facility and earliest offshore team can reach office is 8:45 AM IST. Hence suitable time for daily calls is 9 AM IST (10:30 PM EST after daylight saving and 11:30 PM EST for now). Participant in these calls should be Parag, Seema (since she has to coordinate with offshore BA) and offshore team including me. If any particular day Parag feels that answering a query will need Beths help, he will invite her for the call. Same is true about Seema. If she needs any help from Santosh, she will invite him for any particular day.


1. Review process:
We need to document review process and its results. This is true about reviews being done at offshore as well as any review that Parag / Beth might do. I am enclosing a DataTech review log template which we have been using for long. I am sure Parag must have used this for long too. He can explain it to you. I am fine with using any GoldBank template too but important is that review comments should not just remain in emails.



1. Query and issue log:
What I said about review (should not remain in mails only) is true about queries also. So we need to update Query issue log at least on weekly basis. This can be a joint responsibility of Parag and me.



1. Managing changes to requirements:
Documenting changes to requirements is of utmost importance (more than queries and review). I am enclosing a log that we have been using.

I was going through GoldBank ETL standards and found reference to GoldBank Informatica Mapping Development Specification Workbook and found that it has provision for tracking changes. I am fine with using this workbook as change tracking mechanism, but every change should be reflected in the workbook. I think this also relates to one of your agenda item of How we are going to define requirement.



In short, we are fine with using any mechanism for tracking and documenting (including using GoldBank templates), but we should define the process before we begin.

I have similar thoughts on testing, but we can discuss that later. I will go through any documentation that Praveen has and then will send my thoughts on testing.



Let us discuss these topics tomorrow.



Thanks,



kishor Deshpande

The sharepoint and VDI issues are independent.  

1) VDI does not allow any file transfers.   In effect, you will be logging on in India to a PC in W-S.   You wont' be able to plug in a USB drive, you won't be able to access any other machine in India to transfer data.   As I understand, when you start the VDI, it will 'disable' some functionality on your PC to prevent any data transfer.  We will not be able to change that...  The only option would be a full VPN link, but that will be a process which we probably ought to delay.   CTS and TaTa have  been successfully using VDI. 

2) Sharepoint is standard sharepoint.   There are no additional limitations other than the fact that GoldBank does not make sharepoint available outside of the Intranet.   'Downloading' in this environment would mean pulling from sharepoint with your VDI console to your virtual machine, making any changes through that virtual manchine, and then uploading back to sharepoint.   At no time will any data ever exist on a machine in India.

Henry,

1. Review log and query logs were attached with my originial mail with subject 'process documents'.
2. I have a concern using GoldBank Sharepoint in the way you hve described. I hope we will be able to download documents locally on VDI machine and upload from there. This is because we might need to download documents and make changes and puload again.

I was going through GoldBank ETL standards and found reference to GoldBank Informatica Mapping Development Specification Workbook and found that it has provision for tracking changes. I am fine with using this workbook as change tracking mechanism, but every change should be reflected in the workbook. I think this also relates to one of your agenda item of How we are going to define requirement.



In short, we are fine with using any mechanism for tracking and documenting (including using GoldBank templates), but we should define the process before we begin.

I have similar thoughts on testing, but we can discuss that later. I will go through any documentation that Praveen has and then will send my thoughts on testing.



Let us discuss these topics tomorrow.



Thanks,

            Diwali is the most important festival in India and hence there might be few leaves in the week of 28th October.



1. Leaves  Once we finalize all the team members (or latest by 10th October), I will send you leave plan for all offshore team members. Going forward, I will send you leave plan for every month by 25th of previous month.
2. Backup planning 
	1. Since we have a development team of 6, testing team of 4, we will need to have at least 1 backup resource to take care of work during any leaves.
	2. Henry, will it be possible to get GoldBank ID for 1 additional resource who can be non billable backup?

FYI, We are organizing the project to a finer level of detail now.  

First, we want just the INVENTORY of columns as quickly as we can get it.   That will allow several tasks to kick off in parallel.  I am hoping that his takes a week.   It enables a number of other things.  

1) Next step for SAS / BA folks which will be to document transformations
2) Tie the columns together by name between the 12 sources (this may be a non-issue)
3) Have business start creating definitions for these columns
4) Tie the columns to the USM and do gap analysis

We are perhaps planning to bring bring all of this information in to a database, so the format of the spreadsheet is critical.   That is why we have formally defined the templates.    Let's adhere to it strictly, but do call a meeting if you have suggestion for format change.

I had a long discussion with Manaswani yesterday. I had asked her to put down her summary of the discussion and the same is detailed below. Some points such as credit card domain knowledge etc i have replied back to her with the corrections.

Plus Points

1. More maturity in terms of exposure and experience
2. Executed similar type of work (developing S-T mappings) earlier also
3. Answered the questions in a better fashion

Areas Of Improvement

1. Needs to understand SAS & concepts of CR

She was fine devoting extra work hours , when needed and also commitment to be with the project.

I think she is a better choice to opt between Sandesh Agrawal & herself.

Thanks,

Dear Sir/Madam,



I would like to thank you all for the offer. I accept all the terms and conditions presented in the documents but I before sending across the acceptance letter I would like to make the following points that were discussed earlier.



1. I am currently on vacation in India till 18th September and I will be able to resign only after reaching US.

2. I have no idea about the number of days that i need to serve after resigning from CTS, hence I cannot provide the exact date of joining.

3. If CTS does not provide me the return ticket from US, DataTech will provide the air ticket from US to Mumbai.



Please let me know if the above conditions are acceptable.

Here are the answers

1) You have to modify the template with respect to the LOB you are working on. I had created the template for the first LOB , BMSC so there might be some file names remaining in the template. We have to put the details as per the Monthly Processing word document corresponding to LOB for which analysis is done.

2) We have to put the dataset name / txt file name corresponding to LOB as applicable. There is a place to put the file type (SAS/TXT/CSV)....

3) Yes You can put a column for Format. I have added the columns (Format, Transformation and Is Present in HUB) in the attached sheet. You can take this as reference.

Send me the excel sheet for Mortgage, I will review it , add the \" Is Present in HUB\" column and send it across.

Subject: Queries regarding Inventory File

Hi Seema,



As per todays discussion we have started to create the inventory files for the Mortgage LOB.



Following are the queries:

* In the Monthly Extract worksheet it is mentioned that the Source System Extract Name is 'BMSC_MMMYYYY.txt.
So what will be Input file name? We are getting confused.

* In the Monthly Staging Dataset worksheet what should be the Input file name as the data are coming from different datasets.
* There should be a column named Formats in the Template. Most of the variables are assigned with some formats and if we will specify only its
Data type, we may face some problem in the upcoming stage.





We will be sending the Inventory File for Mortgage LOB by the EOD.





Thanks & Regards,

Attached is the doc where I have gone through all of the people we currently have tagged and tried to match a req id, rate and role.   I have a few missing req numbers that may or may not currently be on record.   If we can find any missing reqs to tie to them, lets start there.   Then, we can get Chris to create a few more reqs for whatever is left. 



Finally we are ramping up pretth heavily in October and November with around 10 more folks.   We'll get that list published by early next week.

Im confused here.  I have submitted and resubmitted the staffing model at least 3 times.  Each was based upon an internal spreadsheet staffing model developed by Henry and some of the team members.  Im not sure why these sorts of requests continue to arise.  The staffing model in SFDC has included Henry and the rest of the team members listed below for a couple months now.



Perhaps, somebody can provide me some guidance as to why you guys are not receiving this information?

I have done some changes in the excel sheet to accommodate the end -to -end analysis that we want to do for each LOB monthly processing.

1) Changed the format to Source ---> Transformation----> Target till Monthly Staging Dataset is created.
2) Since Combined dataset process is just to combine all monthly dataset into one, there wont be any transformation involved.

To answer your queries:
Field/Column Description, - If you find any comments/additional information for the field during analysis , it can be put or just leave it blank
Derived(Y/N) - If there are any transformation / calculation then the field is derived.
Unique Key(Y/N) - Ignore it for now.

We would discuss in detail the changes and the MLA sheet when you are in office. Just ping me when you come.

Regards
Seema

There is a user defined format program which is updated and executed every month before the monthly processing happens and datasets are created.

( See Section 2.1 of the CCRM Current Monthly Processing_v1.doc).

As per the input from Melanie this is mostly used for format definition while reporting, but we would just double check and analyze the source code , if its affecting any of the stages in the CCRM process till creation of Cohort dataset

( Mainframe Source ----->Flat File---------> Monthly Staging Dataset -----------> Combined Dataset
                                                                                                 ------------> Cohort Dataset -------> HTML Reporting).

I had a look at the latest program from the G:\Drive. It does not seem to affect the mapping/Inventory analysis thats being done now. I just want to you confirm this.

Attaching the program modified on 9/17.

I have reviewed and discussed the MLA  Mortgage Inventory analysis document with Henry and Beth. The transformations put up and the template is OK and we can go ahead with this template and approach to analyze rest of the LOBs.



-          I have done the HUB gap analysis for MLA and updated the sheet sent today.

-          Created the analysis sheet template for other LOBs based on the monthly processing logic. These templates and Query log is copied on the shared drive \\Punnfil02\GoldBank CCRM$\09172008. Please validate these and start using for other LOBs.

-          There is a hidden column K in first tab of all the sheets. Please ignore that. I have added it for HUB gap analysis comments.

-          The tabs in the excel sheets are different based on the processing logic e.g.

o        We have to process CLS, RAC and SFW for Train 2 only so there is no monthly extract (txt or csv)  created and the SAS code generates monthly staging dataset. In this case the second tab drops off and the target file in first tab changes.

o        CLS and ILS are further segmented into 2 LOBs. So there is an additional tab in the corresponding sheet.

-          Debtosh and Partha can continue the MLA analysis for remaining stages.

-          Next LOBs to be analyzed is CLS.



Please review the templates as per the Monthly processing document and Visio. Let me know in case of any discrepancy.



You can call me on my cell 336-251-5739 and we can get into a call (if required). Or I will talk to you tomorrow from office.

I feel if there is any important decision we are taking (like yday he reviewed the sheet and agreed with the format/approach to continue analysis) , or reaching a milestone. we should keep him in loop.

For daily statuses , I agree its not necessarily required to copy him.

Should we be copying Henry on daily status mails? Let us decide this at this stage only as later we can not change our decision.

Ref : Query # 3 in the log

Attached is the latest version of Gladstone documentation for all core LOB's. This is the so called 'CCRM Data Dictionary' that we have at this point in time.

Putting the field description in Inventory analysis sheet is not that critical (at least now) but eventually we have to come up with a data dictionary( For Existing CCRM Process).

Once SAS program analysis is complete someone can start going through the attached documentation (and the SAS - PROC CONTENT) to build data dictionary.

I did a walkthrough of the Mortgage - MLA Inventory document for Melanie and Brad. They liked the approach and told that all the necessary details are being captured.

They had few suggestions and review comments

* Field/column description can be pushed off for now until we come up with data dictionary.
* They would like to see some kind of reference of All_Format.sas in the transformation (I have sent a separate mail for this).
* There is absolutely no transformation happening while creating cohort and combined dataset. Its just a different representation of Staging dataset. ( But we will keep that tab - Combined & Cohort dataset for our reference in the sheet and continue to fill that for other LOB's, which will not take much time. It would show end to end flow in a single sheet.)
* The 'Format' column is not that important . We will keep it for our reference. I will hide it while doing a walkthrough for them.
* In the transformation column we need not put the SAS code as it is. It can be put in words also. The calculations , assigning values , hard coding, IF THEN logic etc should be put as it is , to derive business rules while HUB--->USM--->Mart mapping. But the codes like THEN DO; etc can be rephrased.
* Priority of LOB's for analysis  - CLS , Train 2 datasets , ILS, BankCard and then rest of the LOB's
Also I have few comments :
* In the transformation column , in one tab its 'STRAIGHT MOVE' and in other tab its 'straight move'. Either keep it upper case or lower case but consistent across all sheets. Actual SAS code n uppercase or lowercase is OK as its just copy n paste from program. But other details should be consistent.
* I corrected this for MLA sheet. So no need to rework on it. Start the CLS analysis and incorporate the review comments.

I am yet to get the copy of project plan from Henry but what he discussed with me and Adam at his desk has very aggressive deadlines which is targeting the SAS programs analysis (offshore) and CCRM data profiling&HUB gap analysis (onsite) by Sept end.

In continuation to the mail below

The 'All_format.sas' program defines the various user formats and is applied to the fields during monthly processing. This should be reflected some where in the Inventory Analysis that we are doing

I thought of this option:
        Create a Analysis document of All_Formats.sas program and put a reference of this document in the sheet.
For e.g.. Check row 31 in 2nd tab of MLA sheet. There should be a pointer to $mla_loan_purpose format.


This way the transformation column won't grow huge and we need not revisit the sheets already created.
Let me know your thoughts on this and if you have any other option.

Hi Sandesh

There is a user defined format program which is updated and executed every month before the monthly processing happens and datasets are created.

( See Section 2.1 of the CCRM Current Monthly Processing_v1.doc).

As per the input from Melanie this is mostly used for format definition while reporting, but we would just double check and analyze the source code , if its affecting any of the stages in the CCRM process till creation of Cohort dataset

( Mainframe Source ----->Flat File---------> Monthly Staging Dataset -----------> Combined Dataset
                                                                                                 ------------> Cohort Dataset -------> HTML Reporting).

I had a look at the latest program from the G:\Drive. It does not seem to affect the mapping/Inventory analysis thats being done now. I just want to you confirm this.

Attaching the program modified on 9/17.

Attached is the list of SAS programs that creates Monthly CCRM reporting from Cohort and Combined datasets.

These programs are to be analyzed :
* To check if there is any manipulation done on the fields from the dataset before displaying it on report or its pulled on repot as it is.
* This analysis would help us to come up with the design of datamart , the dimensions , hierarchies etc
This need not be a part of Inventory sheets that team is working on now.

Also, can you put together estimates for 1 LOB going by time it took for MLA?



I think our effort for next LOBs should be lesser once process is clear.



Before our tomorrow's meeting, can you please send a plan assuming we have to complete all LOBs by 30th? The plan should include start date, end date, LOB, resource name and reviewer name (which should be you or Sunil).

Assign simple LOBs to Mugdha and complex ones to Debtosh and Partha. Also, we need to get Sandesh and Manaswini upto speed and allocate 1 LOB to them but in the back end plan for Debtosh to do it in th end.

Sunil,



We dont need to work on week end.

Can you please make following changes:

1. Change delivery date to 3rd October as you suggested. Our original plan was to complete it in 4 weeks and we are compressing it to 2 weeks. This should be good enough. I will convey to Henry that we will deliver everything on 6th October.
But having said this, my gut feel is that Debtosh and Partha will not need more than 4 days per LOB and we will end up completing task earlier.

1. Take out any allocation on week ends
2. You have allocated a task to Manaswini. She has been proposed for a requirement in CLSA. So if she is not available, we might have to allocate her work to some one else. Please plan for this contingency.


Another important thing for you and Sandesh  please ensure that Debtosh, Partha, Sandesh A and Mugdha are not working after 6 PM (or more than 9 hours). No burnouts in this early stage of project!

Sandesh,



Thanks for a clear status.

Can you please update original excel with plan for reverse engineering and for each LOB add a column status?



It will be easier to keep track.

Also, important thing for you to note is: At any point of time, if you feel that our final delivery date of 3rd October is in a risk of slipped by even a day, please raise a flag so that we can take corrective action.

Hi kishor, Jaideep,



Please see the note from Adam, our PM, regarding getting started with staffing the two developer roles.   The requisitions were submitted via salesforce a while ago.   If Im not mistaken, we would like to request Abishek (recent hire from CTS) in the BA role.



Please note that these roles need to start October 6 so we need to get these people locked in quickly.



Thanks

Sandesh,



As you know you are getting allocated to GoldBank CCRM from 6th October for 2.5 months.



I know that you have onsite aspirations and you also must be aware that we are working towards that.

Work permit for Australia takes at least 5 weeks and for sure, you will not be traveling to Australia for next 5-6 weeks.



Hence I recommend you to get allocated to CCRM and work till you actually travel to Australia. Most probably, it will be almost end of your assignment in GoldBank. If there is anything pending in GoldBank, Harshpal and I can complete it.



I hope you are OK with this.

Virendra, are you OK with this? Sandesh has done a good job of pulling together the GoldBank team so far and we are ahead of project plan much of which can be attributed to Sandesh. So I would like to retain Sandesh in GoldBank for as long as possible till he travels to Australia.

We have problems with requisitions.

1. There is still no requisition for Seema and me
2. There is only 1 requisition for developer in Oct. It should have been 2
3. There is a tester requisition in Oct, which is not required.


Will Adam have bandwidth to work on requisitions?

Sandesh,



Can you address following question  are you keeping query log with all queries or you are creating a new one for every day / task?

I had this query and Seema also had this query yesterday.



Only option is to keep a single log. So if you have not done it so far, please do it.



Thanks,

-          Updated the query log in the shared folder. I saw one under \\Punnfil02\GoldBank CCRM$\Docs from Seema with 2 new questions. However I did not find any CLS questions. Please send the CLS queries in the log. I will answer them and/or get the answers from Melanie.

-          Attached is the BMSC inventory file with source copybook inventory. Similar files (with only attributes and HUB mapping) are deliverable this week for Melanie. She will verify them. I should be able to put them in shared drive by end of Thursday still WIP.

kishor: since there was a slight change in the approach we were doing, some of the efforts till now would not be counted.



Client had earlier asked to do an analysis on Train 2 data, but now we are supposed to do T1 data analysis only, T2 is in scope but since there are no transformations applied on T2 elements, it is a straight analysis, Seema has already done that I guess.



So for CLS it is now a shortened scope (T1 with 45 elements) from T2 with over 1600 data elements. There were no major impact on the SFW and RAC LOBs, only CLS is affected.



Still we are good according to the timelines, but I thought I should make it clear to everyone at this point.

As per the tracker 'Onsite Review Progress' is for RAC,SFW,ILS and CLS.
I have got only ILS and RAC sheets to review.

I don't have CLS and SFW yet ( I am assuming its not sent bcoz of queries pending?).

Also for Mortgage 'Delivered', I did not get the formatted sheet after our last discussion on Friday. is it in shared drive?

Today I did a walkthrough of the inventory sheets (which was our intermediate deliverable) for Susan.
Inventory listing is fine with minor changes that I would be working on.

Next steps :
* After the transformation (SAS reverse engineering) is done for all LOB's. I would be reviewing those along with IT and we will come up with final data elements for the mart.
* Meanwhile other SAS program to be analyzed are as follows (priority in that order). Details and programs are already sent
		-  All_Formats.sas - Use DataTech analysis template to document this.This would be a word document I guess.
		- Reporting SAS codes  - I will get back to you regarding this template.
		- Data Dictionary from Gladstone. (Will check for template and send it across, else we can use already existing template)
* Start the Business Rule Document.  Will check for the template/existing document.

I have reviewed the ILS and RAC transformations. The queries on these are answered and closed.
I will combine the HUB gap analysis columns (which I have done as part of column listing) and put the final document back to the shared folder. So that we have a single sheet for transformation as well as inventory.

Hi Seema,



I have mentioned the Status CLS and SFW as Onsite Review Progress as they were being changed after getting your suggestions.

For Mortgage, we will be sharing the formatted sheet today. (We missed out on sharing the updated sheet)



Today we will be sharing draft copies of CLS, Prime, Lend with you.



There will be a delay of one day in deliveries of SFW and CC from offshore. This will be covered up by Monday and Tuesday.

We will still meet the deadline of completing 90% by Wednesday.



Note:  We always keep updated copies of files in shared drive.



Thanks & Regards

Hi Sunil



As per the tracker 'Onsite Review Progress' is for RAC,SFW,ILS and CLS.

I have got only ILS and RAC sheets to review.



I don't have CLS and SFW yet ( I am assuming its not sent bcoz of queries pending?).



Also for Mortgage 'Delivered', I did not get the formatted sheet after our last discussion on Friday. is it in shared drive?

Thanks & Regards

kishor: since there was a slight change in the approach we were doing, some of the efforts till now would not be counted.



Client had earlier asked to do an analysis on Train 2 data, but now we are supposed to do T1 data analysis only, T2 is in scope but since there are no transformations applied on T2 elements, it is a straight analysis, Seema has already done that I guess.



So for CLS it is now a shortened scope (T1 with 45 elements) from T2 with over 1600 data elements. There were no major impact on the SFW and RAC LOBs, only CLS is affected.



Still we are good according to the timelines, but I thought I should make it clear to everyone at this point.



Thanks,

Hi kishor, Jaideep,







Please see the note from Adam, our PM, regarding getting started with staffing the two developer roles.   The requisitions were submitted via salesforce a while ago.   If I'm not mistaken, we would like to request Abishek (recent hire from CTS) in the BA role.







Please note that these roles need to start October 6 so we need to get these people locked in quickly.

Specifications were never planned to be created by an architect and never have been.  This is typically done by the BA.  However, Abhisheck can give us a head start with Hub to WRK and make sure that developer's have something to do next week.   I do have a develoiper role in mind for Anand - he can just help us out in the short term and get ahead with some very simple specs.

Henry,



We have not talked for last 2 weeks and I would have loved to talk to you but It is a very busy week for me as we are wrapping up final phase of our project. If you get chance, you can call me any time between 2:30 PM to 6:30 PM EST on 0044-7776247215 (my UK cell number).



Following are some updated that I wanted to talk to you:



1. We have received secure cards and we will check connectivity tomorrow. If we need any help, we will get in touch with Seema / Parag.
2. Anand will be joining on 1st October. He will undergo DataTech induction for first couple of days and then will join the team. However, as per project plan, specifications are to be created by ETL architect. If we are expecting Anand to start creating specifications, let us start with one more developer (thus, 2 developers doing development as planned and Anand doing specifications). This will not have any impact on billing as Anand will start billing in next slot.
3. You must have got this update from Seema  LGRED SAS code reverse engineering is 80% over and we plan to complete it by this week end.
4. We have to send a weekly status report to Rahul Pathak and Virendra. I am enclosing herewith sample report that is created by Compass team. I am sending a separate mail to Adam to fill onsite part of the report.

I assume that Anand will one of the first developer's to start.    That being the case, he can immediately begin producing the specifications for our simplest of mappings based on the source inventory and transfer this knowledge to BA if we want.  Anand  begins at Cap on Wednesday.   We can have him start on the project then.   



Are you personally going to be starting full-time on the 6th?   Will you be back in India with the team?  





Let me know what time works best for you.

Henry,



Can we have a conference call on 6th October to discuss the status? I, 2 BAs and 2 ETL developers start on that day. I am OK with any time that you and Santosh prefer.

In the mean time, can you please send me detailed project plan if you have published / created it?



Thanks,

Adam has not started on the 171 project yet.   He does not start until October although he is spending some of his 'leisure' time with us.     



For now, the project and staffing plan in the SOW is what we are working under.   I am working with Shauna and Adam to have the detailed plan out this week.  



Yes, we should have one SAS developer on online this week.  



Status of tokens is unknown.  





I would suggest that some of the questions below are better surfaced in our conference calls.   I hope we can all make it this week.

Adam,



Offshore team has started working since last week, but first billable week starts today. I have following questions regarding this:



1. Can you please send detailed project plan that you must have presented to GoldBank
2. Do we have any progress on connectivity and VPN tokens for offshore?


Henry, I am assuming that from today, 1 offshore resource will be charging time to CCRM project code.

Here is the status
1. Defining USM requirements and gaps for at least half of LOBs (this is your responsibility)
>>>Not started on this. However I have completed the Source to HUB gap analysis and got the information about missing fields / sources from Peggy. SHEFF and LENDMARK are missing in HUB (will be populated by NOV).And there is one more additional step identified. HUB-->WRK mapping which is a straight mapping. This will be done by Anand (that's planned)
1. Design ETL architecture (Beth)
>>>She is working on the Data Model.
1. Analysis of LGRED code (Offshore  this is likely to be completed by this week end as per schedule)
>>>This will include the analysis and documentation of All_Formats.sas and Reporting SAS codes as well. There are talks (Susan mentioned this on last Thursday) about including Train2 data elements from other sources (other than SFW, CLS and RAC as mentioned in SOW). It will be clear in our meeting with IT tomorrow. I will update you. Definitely it will be a CR.
1. Start business documentation  We have not yet started this. You need to speed this up. Can you send template for this so that offshore can get started? We should get at least 1 document out to review to Melanie by this week end.
>>> As I understand , the Transformations listed in the Inventory sheets along with Gladstone details would form the Business Rules. We have to put them in a comprehensive document with more details.I discussed about the template and got the attached one from SOW. This can be a starting. In the Description column, the Gladstone definition can be put.Let me know your comments.
1. Data Mapping from HUB to USM & Subs extracts to USM should have started. (This is your activity. Have you started this?)
>>> Not yet started. Will be starting this week.

If you need further details, Schedule a conf call and let me know. I will log on.

Seema,



I am going to talk about this to Adam and Henry anyway, but I have following question for you:



Enclosed is the project plan that we have given to GoldBank.

By this week end, we should have completed following activities:



1. Defining USM requirements and gaps for at least half of LOBs (this is your responsibility)
2. Design ETL architecture (Beth)
3. Analysis of LGRED code (Offshore  this is likely to be completed by this week end as per schedule)
4. Start business documentation  We have not yet started this. You need to speed this up. Can you send template for this so that offshore can get started? We should get at least 1 document out to review to Melanie by this week end.
5. Data Mapping from HUB to USM & Subs extracts to USM should have started. (This is your activity. Have you started this?)


I am going to set up a call early next week to discuss this. So for now dont explicitly talk to anyone about this. But it will be good if you can let me know status.

Attached is the updated query log.
I have completed the review of SFW.

Please send me the Train2 mapping sheets (CLS,SFW and RAC) in whatever state they are in. These are the sheets which team worked on last week before the Train1 / Train2 scope modified. I would need them for tomorrows meeting. I guess Debtosh worked on CLS for sure. Not sure about RAC and SFW.

The zip file has all LOB's HUB GAP Mapping completed (Train1 & Train2). Copy those in the shared drive.
Anand will be working on the HUB-->WRK mapping based on these sheets. I will be sending the WRK details and login information tomorrow after the tables are created.

Immediate Tasks for this week:
* Complete the transformation for all LOB's (document + Review).
* Analysis and documentation of all_formats.sas and Reports sas programs.

I will send an update on the business rules document and data dictionary tomorrow.

on closer examination, these reqs don't look right.

For one thing, it has everyone involved with phase 1 in Mumbai.  Also, the start dates don't match what's actually on the project plan.

For instance, I am the project manager, and I start on Oct 6th, with a req number (according to the spreadsheet I received earlier) of 2008-56633-001.  I don't see anything that corresponds to that req number, that start date, or that position for phase 1 on the spreadsheet you sent.  Is it possible there are two sets of reqs for this floating around?  I am attaching the spreadsheet we are working with, which matches the dates we need positions filled for phase 1.  We already have some of the req numbers, and none of them are on the sheet you sent me.

Hi kishor, Jaideep,







Please see the note from Adam, our PM, regarding getting started with staffing the two developer roles.   The requisitions were submitted via salesforce a while ago.   If I'm not mistaken, we would like to request Abishek (recent hire from CTS) in the BA role.







Please note that these roles need to start October 6 so we need to get these people locked in quickly.

Minal,

on closer examination, these reqs don't look right.



For one thing, it has everyone involved with phase 1 in Mumbai.  Also, the start dates don't match what's actually on the project plan.



For instance, I am the project manager, and I start on Oct 6th, with a req number (according to the spreadsheet I received earlier) of 2008-56633-001.  I don't see anything that corresponds to that req number, that start date, or that position for phase 1 on the spreadsheet you sent.  Is it possible there are two sets of reqs for this floating around?  I am attaching the spreadsheet we are working with, which matches the dates we need positions filled for phase 1.  We already have some of the req numbers, and none of them are on the sheet you sent me.

Hi,

Attached are GoldBank reqs currently open in the system. As mentioned earlier Seemas allocation is pending. All the others working on the project have already been allocated.

Chris,







As per my knowledge, Anand will get into developer role and not BA.



Minal has already completed allocation for SAS developers and Minal / Jaideep will take care of rest of the team before 6th October.







Minal, can you please check if requisitions are available now?

Hi kishor, Jaideep,







Please see the note from Adam, our PM, regarding getting started with staffing the two developer roles.   The requisitions were submitted via salesforce a while ago.   If I'm not mistaken, we would like to request Abishek (recent hire from CTS) in the BA role.







Please note that these roles need to start October 6 so we need to get these people locked in quickly.







Thanks

All, 

Let's try to communicate about this together. 

Doug and I discussed the CCRM development data mart both yesterday and today.   In the interim, before the new mart environment is established, we will be using BDWDEV as our development platform.   I do believe that Doug has the needed information to set up the new CCRM data mart development environment - let me know if something is missing Doug.

The task to establish this environment was what we discussed today in our 9:30 call.   A tentative date for Nov 7th was set.   I talked with Doug immediately after the call and he did feel this date was aggressive.   I am waiting to hear back from him with another date.   

Please let me know if I have misinterpreted anywhere Doug.   

Do you want me to involve you in hardware, software and environment discussions Peggy?    If so, I apologize because I did not realize that was one of your roles.

Doug and I have also discussed the VDI / SAS issue.   It will require some coordination between Help Desk and VDI support.   I'm gathering information.   

Brad, Melanie,

To put this in a nutshell, we do not have a development data mart platform for CCRM at this point.   We have a contingency plan that can get us through October, but it will become critical in November to have this new environment established as we start to load the four years of history.

I don't believe there is no CCRM Data Mart Environment at this time (I thought establishing this environment and building the MART was the purpose of this initiative). Other than getting this note from Henry, Doug has not received any direction/information on getting this environment set up. In addition, the project plan doesn't appear to include the task for establishing the environment and/or the preceding task that help you determine the specific's for how you would set up this environment.

Maybe I'm overlooking these task in the project plan..but regardless I don't think we can set-up an environment based on the limited information that was provided in Henry's note below.

        No. You have not communicated anything incorrectly that we discussed. However like I stated, today was the first I had heard of  a November date.

I have attached the status report for our activities this week.  At the client's request, we are tying the week's activities back to line items on the SOW.  Can we keep off-shore and on-shore activities on one tab? 

We have a status meeting on Thursday afternoons with the client, and will be capturing our status on Thursday mornings.

Hi Seema,



We have received the RSA Tokens and User ID details.



But I am not able to logon using RSA.



Following information is not available. If you know more on this then kindly provide the information.



User Name  A70368 (This is for me. - We have received as part of parcel.)

LAN Password ??

PIN - ??



In the available documentation only LAN User id is provided. It is mentioned that enter the LAN PWD and PIN + RSA.

But we dont have these details.



Should we give a call to Helpdesk number mentioned in the document or let us know in case you have more information.



PF below screenshot.



Thanks & Regards

Sunil Pathak



Reference 

In FDI, when we logon using the RSA first time, we had to enter the User ID and RSA Number only.

Once we do this it will ask us to enter the PIN.



After this Henceforward, we use to enter User id, PIN + RSA and Password.

As you are aware, there is tremendous turmoil in the Banking industry which is creating a great deal of anxiety in the community and among our clients.  The anxiety has been heightened by the FDIC assisted sale of Wachovia to Citigroup.

While we are not immune to the chWhiteges in the capital markets and home lending is a significant business for us, the good news is that GoldBank is strong and financially sound.  Our capital ratios, debt ratings, and earnings are among the best in the banking industry.

In this environment, it is very important to be communicating with your clients to reaffirm GoldBanks value proposition:  Reliable, Responsive, Empathetic and Competent.  Reliability is the most important attribute to demonstrate to our clients today.  Be reassuring to your clients that GoldBank is sound and both able and willing to help them with their financial needs.

It is also an excellent time to call on prospects.  Many of our competitor banks are hiding from their clients.  We have nothing to hide and can be proud of our financial strength and heritage.  For 126 years, GoldBank has grown and prospered in all types of chWhiteging economic times.  GoldBank will not only navigate the current storm but will be even more successful in the future.

GoldBank:  The Best Bank in Town since 1872

Best wishes!

Thanks Henry.
BAs are currently working on business rules documents which need to be delivered to Brad/Melanie. SAS developers will be finishing reverse engineering of reporting code in 2 days.
More importantly, we are facing a small issue in connectivity which I suspect is because of IDs not activated for thin client access. Seema is going to talk to Dough about this shortly. Hence in the mean time developers will complete HUB--WRK mapping till connectivity is set up. Thus, we are still on track for delivering HUB--WRK in time. In fact, in next 3-4 days we will send you detailed plan by LOB for this.

For history migration, we can export SAS datasets to flat files or to a database. We can then use this database as input for history. We just need to create tables in DB2.

Subject: RE: Tasks for week of 6th October

Welcome on kishor.

We had discussed something different last week.  

Anand was going to take the time to show the two new BA how to do a
HUB -> WRK mapping document.   When they were trained, they would
proceed to creating the rest of the HUB -> WRK map documents and
Abhischek / Sunil would begin coding.   If we don't start coding until
specs are complete, what will the developers do in the meantime?   We
can discuss in status call.

For History migration we need to do the following in the short term.
They do not have SAS component of Informatica (I've been told).   We'll
need to load this into database in another way.   We also want to get
some of this data loaded ASAP for profiling purposes.   One option is
DBIMPORT.   Another is FTP to INFA box and then use Informatica.   We'll
need to find a landing spot on the INFA box for that.   Thoughts?

We have almost finalized GAP analysis with Hub.   When we do, IT will be
presented with a decision.    Can they resolved Hub GAPS within our
required timeframe?   If not, we will proceed otherwise.   At this
point, I am unsure if they can meet our requirements.   If all goes
well, we should be able to do all Hub -> WRK in less than a month.   We
will hopefully use the exact same extracts in use now if the Hub does
not replace.

Henry, Adam,



We are working on following tasks in current week:



Task

Delivery date

Description

HUB --> WRK Specifications

10th October

Anand has started on this task. We will involve 1 more developer
along with Anand to ensure we complete specifications and send it to
review as soon as possible.

We plan to start ETL development for HUB--> WRK as soon as we complete
specifications

Business rules documentation for all LOBs

13th October

We have already sent business rules for 2 LOBs and Santosh has reviewed 1
document. Brad and Melanie are currently reviewing the document. We plan
to complete all LOBs by this week end.

Documentation of all reporting programs

9th October

Complete documentation of reporting programs



Questions: (We can discuss these questions in tomorrow's call)

1.      Can we get a draft version of data model? Once we finalize the
model, it will be easier to start work on history migration.
2.      For subsidiaries that are not present in HUB, are we going to
extract data from extract files to CCRM directly (which was our original
proposal) or wait for those fields to be added to HUB and then take them
to CCRM (This will add to our effort)?

Lloyd,



I just received these time entries for the following individuals via Oracle.  I thought all of our resources were not set to enter all time in Clarity?   I believe these are our offshore resources.

Chris, Henry,



It was not clear to us that time needs to be entered in Clarity. We are working on setting up associates in clarity.

By this week end, I will ensure that we have billing as per following:

Mugdha Kale  She is ETL developer who had entered billable time as she was not aware of her billing start date (as I was returning from UK to India, I was not reachable). She will enter a negative time so that effectively she does not bill to client.



2nd October was a public holiday in India and 9th October is also a public holiday.



In short, we will get all timecards corrected by this week end and I will send detailed billing report when it is done.

        The VDM connection broker is listed as Virtual Desktop Manager 1 or Virtual Desktop Manager 2.   Starting on page 7, and continuing on to page 8,  the directions say to use one of those links.

You understood how it initiated. Praveen is working on the test cases and he was looking at the transformation docs as detailed mapping specs - which we are in process of building....
I have explained Henry that since offshore don't have access to HUB - it was not cross checked for column name - In CLS the column name in HUB and the way Bill defined in his code is not consistent.

Praveen is playing HIS part now:) Q310 is getting over and He will be in Q171:)

HI Kevin

After installing the VDM client, when the team is trying to access the VDM server, Its giving the error as attached in the mail.

Please help us for this error. I guess this is the last step towards getting connected to BBnT remote.

Seema,

In this case, as the documentation states, the VDM client needs to be installed on the physical workstations in India.  It seems that this is what is required for this, based on the little bit of information in the ticket.

The VDM client can be found at:

We let you know of a VDI connectivity issue we are having this morning.   We just had two developers come on board in India today and they are unable to work so this is an urgent issue. 

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there is anything we can do to help.   Seema and I are at your disposal if needed.

Seema,



Attached are the mapping documents for Bankcard (Retail and Commercial), CC and RAC. We have followed the same format used earlier in Q310. We have not added the default field (Period_Ending_Dt, LST_UPD_TS,SRC_STM_CD) as of now. Since they are generic fields, we will add them once the review is complete and approved by you.

For Bankcard we will have only 1 set of WRK tables for both Retail and Commercial since they are fetching the same columns from the same table and separate datasets are created at a later stage.

Please find enclosed weekly status report for GoldBank CCRM project for week ending 10/24.



Highlights of this week:



1. First draft of data mart logical model submitted for client review.
2. Data mapping from WRK to USM layer started.


Concerns:

1. Though we got connectivity for offshore established 3 weeks back, development environment for offshore team has not yet been setup. During last 3 weeks, we have worked on other tasks that do not need actual connection to GoldBank server. But effectively, we have lost 4-5 days of productive time due to development environment not available. Originally, we were slightly ahead of schedule, but this setback means we are now slightly behind schedule. This is not a major risk as of now and hence we have not changed project status to Yellow. But if development environment is not established in next 2-3 days, we will have to communicate yellow status to client.

Reason: We have lost almost 4 weeks due to delay at client side in installation of required softwares. We are estimating impact of this on project timelines. At this point, delay in meeting final deliverable timelines should not be more than 2-3 weeks which we hope to cover during next 1 month.

Sunil is already allocated to development requisition. He will continue allocated there.
For tester role starting this week, we will allocate Ritesh. Sunil will lead test team but will continue allocated to developer requisition.

For one more tester role starting 3rd week, we will find one more resource. Sunil will still continue leading testing.

Highlights for last week:



1. Received formal client sign off on business rules and architecture
2. Completed development of HUB ` WRK ETL
3. Completed test cases for HUB ` WRK
4. Started work on WRK ` STG MART mapping


Important: There is a major change in architecture / approach for the project. Instead of moving data from (HUB to USM to CCRM), we will move data from (HUB to CCRM). This approach was approved by client last week. Because of this there might be some reduction in effort for critical path activities. We hope that in next 2 weeks we will be in line with project plan and will recover time lost due to delay in software installations from client side.



We got sign off on business rules and architecture last week and next deliverables are mapping documents which are to be delivered between 15th and 25th December in phases.

A couple of notes.   One is that Brad's list is getting out of sync from Santosh's original proposal.   As examples. reporting and BDW are not included, and additions include new source systems.   We won't be able to directly use those estimates.   I don't believe we can call anything out of scope at this point because it was not in the original proposal.  There are several new sherrifs in town   Being that some of this is brand new aned what all we have for details is a bullet point on an email, we will not be able to do any accurate estimates.

We probably can do a reasonable job of doing relative estimates and with GL being a common thread now and then, we can use that original estimate to judge things in a relative manner.   Adam and I have discussed this and we are putting together some talking points.   We'll be ready to review by Tuesday.

We can officially extend Seema until Jan 31st, 2009 right now.   We can do that with the current budget.  

Before the Christmas holiday we will officially extend her through March.   This will be done either through additional business or a personnel swap.   

In short, if we get production support business from GoldBank, we will keep both Hani and Parag on that project which will run through the first six months of 2009 at minimum.   If we do not get that additional business, then Seema will replace Parag's role on the 171D project and Parag will roll off at the end of January.   We will not have these discussions with Seema and Parag until we know the status of the potential additional business.

OK. If we are extending just 1 BA then we will extend Sandesh Agrawal as Sandesh Menon is not available. In that case we do not need a requisition.

We seem to be on schedule and we have completed 1st round WRK --> STG mapping.

We have to pull together some estimates very quickly for phase-2 of CCRM projects.   One of the potential targets on the list is bringing more applications to Train-2.   Here at GoldBank, they are already at some stage of development and testing for MLS, EQFIN and one other app.   By the time we are finished with phase-1, there will probably be three more applications ready to move to train-2.  


Could you provide an estimate for off-shore team to bring a new application to Train-2 levels.   In my mind, it should be:

1) doing reverse engineering of SAS code to determine business rules
2) formatting and formalizing this information including mapping document modification
3) developing test plans based on mapping document
4) developing code - should be additions to existing Informatica mapping documents.
5) Testing
6) Move to production.



I would like for all future phases to fit within three to four months, so assume staffing to meet that requirement.  Can you give me a offshore staffing model assuming our current onshore roles to upgrade three applications to Train-2 in this time period?

Thanks in advance.

I am mostly with you, but a few questions.

I'm not thinking that the mortgage application would have any visibility to the \"GL adjustments\" at all.   i.e. there would be no 15.   

In that case, we would have 120 versus 100 in your example.

Then, a decision needs to be made as to how to show the 20 at the loan level.  There are two choices.  1) would be to equally allocate that 20 across all loans in the mortgage application.   i.e. if there were 100 loans, each would indicate a 0.20 allocated adjustment.  (There are numerous allocation algorithms possible with one being proportional)    2) the other would be to put in a \"fake\" loan number and show the 20 as a single number which could be rolled up to make the  totals tie.

Subject: RE: Reconcile and consolidate GL



The problem with the current reports is that they are all related to the GL. The GL as you know contains non-cash entries i.e. adjustments. The finance group creates these entries. For the CCRM data to be used by the business, we will have to show them how the loan level data ties up to the GL level data.



Marvin Darr in the finance group has a method to do this since they are also calculating EC at a loan level. That logic needed to be embedded in the CCRM Phase II work so that we can show both GL and non-GL views of the portfolios.



EXAMPLE


Portfolio


Auto


Mortgage


Loan view


100


100


GL adjustments


20


15


Total GL based portfolio


120


115

They are used to seeing the 120 and 115. We will need to show them how the 120 = 100+20. That logic is with the finance group ie Marvin Darr,

Praveen,



As per project plan, we need to start with a new tester from next week.



Damodar Laxman has been working with the team for last 2 months. He has done great on testing front. He has done testing for HUB à WRK and also on history phases. He has handled tasks independently.

We all (Mahesh, Anand and I) have good feedback for him.



You had talked to him for 1st tester requirement, but were not so positive about him.



But things have changed in last 2 months and he has shown good performance.



So can we start with him as 3rd tester? In case you have any issues with his performance, we can replace him immediately.



Let me know your thoughts.

A slight change in plans.  The IT group will be stopping SAS development - seems that they are questioning the value because we are replacing it with informatica.

Santosh,

If you have any poop to add about the business value around any of this - or any other comments - it is invited and welcome.  



All, 

We have also gathered a lot of supporting metrics - number of tables / columns by source, additional fact / dimension tables, etc.   These will be the main drivers for the estimates.   I have worked with kishor already on some of the estimates and will send out the supporting metrics as soon as I consolidate some of the information gathered today.  

I have an estimation model that I have used before, but if there is another one that someone has and can use, it would be good to get more than one estimation for comparison.   In any event, we will all need to buy off and commit to the estimates before they are published.

kishor,



A slight change in plans.  The IT group will be stopping SAS development - seems that they are questioning the value because we are replacing it with informatica.  



So for 5 of the eight remaining sources, they will stop with the Gladstone documents.   I think there are both pros and cons.



1) We won't have to reverse engineer SAS.

2) We won't have any data that has already been tested and verified - we will need to do this as part of development

3) Current Gladstone documentation standards are not adequate for offshore development.   We will have to enhance.



What do you think?

Henry,



Following are estimates for 1 LOB. All estimates are for 1 resource. Thus for 5 LOBs, we will need 5 resources for following duration.



1) doing reverse engineering of SAS code to determine business rules  3 weeks
2) formatting and formalizing this information including mapping document modification  2 weeks
3) developing test plans based on mapping document  - 2 weeks
4) developing code - should be additions to existing Informatica mapping documents.  2 weeks
5) Testing  3 weeks
6) Move to production. 1 week

kishor,

We have to pull together some estimates very quickly for phase-2 of CCRM projects.   One of the potential targets on the list is bringing more applications to Train-2.   Here at GoldBank, they are already at some stage of development and testing for MLS, EQFIN and one other app.   By the time we are finished with phase-1, there will probably be three more applications ready to move to train-2.  



Could you provide an estimate for off-shore team to bring a new application to Train-2 levels.   In my mind, it should be:

1) doing reverse engineering of SAS code to determine business rules
2) formatting and formalizing this information including mapping document modification
3) developing test plans based on mapping document
4) developing code - should be additions to existing Informatica mapping documents.
5) Testing
6) Move to production.



I would like for all future phases to fit within three to four months, so assume staffing to meet that requirement.  Can you give me a offshore staffing model assuming our current onshore roles to upgrade three applications to Train-2 in this time period?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: CLS - estimate for \"extra fact tables\"

Seema,

Did I miss it?   Is there an estimate for Loading the additional fact tables associated with CLS (collateral, lines/loans, participations, fees?)   I see some supporting information (ins and outs), but no estimates?  

In my mind, this is a significant amount of new re-engineering work.  

* Think in these terms.   It will be separate fact tables because of one-to many relationships with current fact.  
* The current fact may then act as a dimension - it will be the parent
* There may (probably) be some new dimensions associated with these fact tables
* There may (probably) be some aggregation work where the multiple rows in these new tables need to be rolled up to a consolidated value for our current fact table.   For instance the value of each collateral record may need to be summarized into the current fact, or the amount of all the participations rolled up.     

Let me know if there are estimates that I have missed or if you need any additional information to do an estimate for this re-engineering.   Basically, each of the current \"extra\" flat files will become a new fact table.

For the Train-2 sources in phase - 2

	BMSC   
	BMSR   
	CC     
	ILS
	EQFIN  
	LEND   
	MLA    
	PRIME  
	SHEFF  

Are there going to be additional source tables needed for these that we don't pull in now? Can I get a list of them for consistency sake.   Each section of doc has section which states the required inputs. 


Also, I know that RMS and/or CIF may be an integral part of some Train-2 sources.   However, we are considering them as completely different sources which have individual estimates.  Therefore, if you have included in some of the existing Train-2 estimates pulling in CIF and/or RMS, please don't include.  That will be included as a whole in a separate section.

So there would be 4 LOB's CC , LEND , PRIME , SHEFF which don't have Train 2 files. In this case too - PRIME HUB table already has Train 2 elements , that's why its in a separate fact.

I have checked the files in <file://\\wil-sasprd02\BaseCreditRisk\CCRM>\\wil-sasprd02\BaseCreditRisk\CCRM BI\Staging

I looked for the SAS code under <file://\\wil-sasprd02\BaseCreditRisk\CCRM>\\wil-sasprd02\BaseCreditRisk\CCRM BI\Q171-D.

Your Opinion on this:



We will have more fact tables to accommodate the CLS T2 flat files currently created, but we need to make sure how these will be roll up/down to the Note level at which our current fact table is.



I recall the discussion with Melanie during mapping session and she mentioned that Line is at a higher level and Note is at Lower level

e.g. A Line of Credit for $1mn will have multiple $250K of Note disbursement.



This is how the CLS files are related

1) NOTE Master File ---> It creates the Line (REC_CODE = 'L') , Commitment (REC_CODE = 'C') and Participation (REC_CODE = 'P). So they can be handled in a child fact table with a link to the parent fact which is at Note Level.



2) AUXILLARY BILL File ----> It creates the Auxiliary Notes and Auxillary Line files from this. I am checking if this can be linked to the parent fact table which is at Note level.



3) Note Extension File ----> Can become a part of the parent fact table. Since its at Note Level.



4) CLS Collateral and Collateral Pointer File ----> Creates Collateral Description , Lien and Pointer file which eventually gets aggregates to AGG_COLL file. If this links to the CLS note level, It will be definitely a separate fact and few modifications to the Collateral Dimension.



As far as the estimation for this goes I would say it would be about 3-4 Man Weeks. What does your estimation say?

So I have 14 weeks with 8 persons  or 114 man-weeks.  How does that compare with what we estimated for phase 1?   This should be a much task in that there is almost no data modeling or architecture work.  The base modules are there, we are only adding columns. 

Just asking these questions so that everyone thinks and gets on the same page.  


I'm assuming that this is an offshore endaevor with only a \"part-time\" coordinator named Seema\").   

So 14 at offshore rate - we'll need to swap some skills in and out there. 

and half time Seema at onshore rate. 

Sound reasonable?

One change -
EQFIN (Leasing) also has Train 2 file in place.
So there would be 4 LOB's CC , LEND , PRIME , SHEFF which don't have Train 2 files. In this case too - PRIME HUB table already has Train 2 elements , that's why its in a separate fact.

I have checked the files in <file://wil-sasprd02/BaseCreditRisk/CCRM>\\wil-sasprd02\BaseCreditRisk\CCRM BI\Staging

I looked for the SAS code under <file://wil-sasprd02/BaseCreditRisk/CCRM>\\wil-sasprd02\BaseCreditRisk\CCRM BI\Q171-D.
Did not find the SAS code , but the Gladstone for Train 2 (ILS and MLS) are in place.

kishor,



A slight change in plans.  The IT group will be stopping SAS development - seems that they are questioning the value because we are replacing it with informatica.  



So for 5 of the eight remaining sources, they will stop with the Gladstone documents.   I think there are both pros and cons.



1) We won't have to reverse engineer SAS.

2) We won't have any data that has already been tested and verified - we will need to do this as part of development

3) Current Gladstone documentation standards are not adequate for offshore development.   We will have to enhance.



What do you think?

Following are estimates for 1 LOB. All estimates are for 1 resource. Thus for 5 LOBs, we will need 5 resources for following duration.



1) doing reverse engineering of SAS code to determine business rules  3 weeks
2) formatting and formalizing this information including mapping document modification  2 weeks
3) developing test plans based on mapping document  - 2 weeks
4) developing code - should be additions to existing Informatica mapping documents.  2 weeks
5) Testing  3 weeks
6) Move to production. 1 week

kishor,

We have to pull together some estimates very quickly for phase-2 of CCRM projects.   One of the potential targets on the list is bringing more applications to Train-2.   Here at GoldBank, they are already at some stage of development and testing for MLS, EQFIN and one other app.   By the time we are finished with phase-1, there will probably be three more applications ready to move to train-2.  



Could you provide an estimate for off-shore team to bring a new application to Train-2 levels.   In my mind, it should be:

1) doing reverse engineering of SAS code to determine business rules
2) formatting and formalizing this information including mapping document modification
3) developing test plans based on mapping document
4) developing code - should be additions to existing Informatica mapping documents.
5) Testing
6) Move to production.



I would like for all future phases to fit within three to four months, so assume staffing to meet that requirement.  Can you give me a offshore staffing model assuming our current onshore roles to upgrade three applications to Train-2 in this time period?

Thanks in advance.

1.   Sounds good.
2.  I worked out the estimates with the \"estimator\" based on the driving factors (inputs and outputs) which are documented.   Above and beyond that, I then kept our on-site staff in tact (six persons).   I'm thinking that should be a pretty good buffer.

4. See above for report analyst.   The total hours with on-site team is about 25k.  We assumed a project life cycle closer to 8->9 months - through the end of the year.  This ramps us up to less than 20 persons.   I agree that we need more on-site coordinator help.   I'll take the on-site level to seven persons. 


We have first session with Brad and Melanie in a few minutes.   We will get the first feel about how 1.5 million without expenses is going to float.   This is very different and a good bit more in terms of new sources than the original blueprint.

Henry,



Following are my comments:



1. I am OK with your estimate for CLS expansion. We have worked it out separately and it comes close to your estimate. I am sending you a separate mail about CLS estimation.
2. My estimate of 114 weeks for Train 2 was without any buffer / consideration for approval / follow up with CCRM. It will be good to increase this estimate by 10%
3. Is reporting included in any of the following estimates? I dont see it as a separate item. Can you please check estimate for reporting?
4. I have a suggestion about onsite team.
	1. I am assuming that Report Analyst mentioned by you will play role of onsite coordinator for reporting team.
	2. Our total estimate for offshore effort is 17790 hours (This will go up slightly if we agree to increase Train 2 estimates)
	3. This translates to 444 man weeks. If we assume project life cycle of 5 months (20 weeks), this effort is 23 offshore resources.
	4. General norm is that 1 onsite coordinator should coordinate work for at most 7 offshore resources. It can go up to 8-9 if requirements are completely frozen. Going by this, we will need 3 dedicated onsite coordinators.
	5. Looking at this from another angle, we have 6 different sub projects and having just 2 onsite coordinators (1 ONC & 1 reporting coordinator) will be a risk.
	6. Summarizing this, I suggest following onsite team:
                                                               i.      Solution Architect

                                                             ii.      ETL architect / modeler

                                                            iii.      Project Manager

                                                            iv.      Test Manager

                                                              v.      Report analyst / Onsite coordinator for reporting

                                                            vi.      Onsite coordinator for Train 2 expansion & CLS expansion. These 2 systems are closely related to phase 1 and some one with phase 1 experience can play this role.

                                                           vii.      Onsite coordinator number 2 for any 2 other sub projects

                                                         viii.      Onsite coordinator number 3 for remaining 2 sub projects

If required, to achieve better cost leverage, we can have Onsite coordinators start on the project after 1 month (i.e. after requirement gathering is partially complete) though we should try to start ONCs from day 1. Also, depending on our comfort level with correctness of requirements, we can look at clubbing ONC 2 and ONC 3 into a single role.

At this point, there is no real staffing model.  I don't believe we need that until after we go through a round of \"tweaking\" to the overall plan.   As both kishor and I calculated, based on the number of hours in the estimate, we are going to have to ramp up to around 20 off-shore folks to finish this by year end.   That is estimated by:

hours effort / hours left in year = approximate number of resources   

For tweaking, I have two hunches:

1) they have decided to do all reporting themselves.   All reporting might get cut.  I am advising against it.
2) At minimum, we will have to tweak down Business Lending Portal.  It might get cut altogether.   If it does though, I'm sure it will come back in phase 3 with the data is contains - customer attributes, scores, relationships.  

3) There is some discussion about the hub and provisioning it. 


We will know a whole lot more in a matter of days.

I am free at 8:30 tomorrow morning.  

I used the infamous \"estimator\" back from Whittemore days.   It has been good to me in the past.   
Then we did all kinds of sanity checks with existing estimates, estimates between us, comparisons between the subprojects, etc. 

I staffed that number all off shore and used on shore as the contingency.  

For the off/on ratio, we are about 2/3 hours offshore and 1/3 onshore.   Three on shore are temporary transferees serving as coordinators.

Henry,



I know this was likely an unpleasant holiday assignment.  Lets try to schedule a call at 8:30 AM ET tomorrow to discuss?  I suspect that there will be some interest in our estimating methodology.  Lets think about how we defend these numbers.  Also, Chris/Anirban will need to understand the rate structure used to get to these numbers and will want to understand the project margin  I know that we are weeks away from deal review.

Kundan,



1. We will start tracking metrics and will start sending it to you shortly.
2. We can not use FSGM templates for test case as we are supposed to use client provided templates. Similarly for query log, we would not like to switch to FSGM templates as we are almost 50% into the project and changing template at this point is not good.


Thanks,

kishor,

Thanks for providing documents. Here are my comments

Query Issue Log:

It is good that we are capturing all queries along with detailed answers for each of the query.

It is recommended to use this template for logging all the queries. Attached is FSGM query log template.



Issue Log: It is recommended to create a separate log for all the risks and issues. 2nd attachment is the template for Risks and Issue log



Team Information sheet: Looks good to me



Test Case: Recommended to use FSGM template for test cases. See 3rd attachment



Work Plan: Up to date



Code review template: You have created a detailed code review checklist. This checklist can be used by a resource before giving code for peer review. Attached is a FSGM standard template to log all the peer review comments.



Metrics:

Ive send you metrics template. Please let me know if we are ready with the metrics sheet



Overall we are doing well in terms of process implementation. It would be excellent in terms of process compliance when we start following all the necessary FSGM templates  



Please let me know if you need further clarification on any of the points

Hi kishor,

As Muthu mentioned in the mail below, Im QL for onsite based projects. Ive already started my QL work on GoldBank from onsite perspective. Currently Im interacting with Adam Barton.

Attached is the mail that I previously sent to Adam about quality analysis that I did based on the documents that Adam sent me



Now I will look in to GoldBank offshore QL activities as well.



To start with, immediate thing we need to implement in GoldBank is metrics. As I understand from Adam, we follow Full Life Cycle. We need to track all important metrics such as Effort Variance, Defect Density, Productivity, etc. Please find attached FSGM metrics template for Full Life Cycle project. I can walk you through this template so that it will be easier for your team to update it. Lets aim to get metrics sheet ready for GoldBank by this month end so that we can use metrics numbers in the Banking QMR which is planned for 1st week of Dec



Let me know if you need a call to discuss these points

Here are my comments:
* Sunil definitely fits the requiremnet for HUB enhancement. As far as I know whenever this project starts , Hani (who was in Q310) will be here for 3 Months and then 1/2 associates from offsore will get transferred here., ofcourse with some overlap with Hani.
* Debtosh/Partha can be one of the reporting Analyst.I havnt met Yogesh, but whatever I spoke to him over conf calls he seems to have good grasp and understanding of business...same feedback for Mahesh as well. And what I got from Praveen is -- Mahesh also has aspirations to travel onsite.
* I am not sure if Parag has discussed this with you , But he wants to come back whenever the Ph2 requiremnet for onsite ramps up. He had conveyed the same to Henry as well. Praveen will also push for Parag for obvious reasons. You know he needs someone here who can handle the DEV as well as Testing coordination.So its up to you to decide who will travel from there.
* Last but not the least..What about my replacement. I wont continue here after MAY. Max Jun mid. Since Schools in India start by then.So if the analysis phase continues beyond MAY. You need to identify someone. Sandesh Menon?? Although I am planning to get my family here, but if they dont adjust here then I might opt to travel back by April end only.Moreover you know bcoz of difference in policy i.e with US salary (which is way way less than the actual US salary for same designation) and no expenses, its difficult survival here especially with family:)
* I hope , I can continue in the same project from offshore when I am back:)

We got approval from Virendra to process 3 US L1 visas for GoldBank team.

I am thinking of Sunil, Debtosh and Partha.



Anands visa will be processed when he completes 1 year (a month before that).



In case we get HUB enhancement project, we can send Sunil (it requires working with Peggy / Susan so we need some one senior).

Debtosh / Partha can be ONC for phase II.



We need an onsite reporting analyst for phase II for which we can consider Debtosh / Partha or Yogesh.



Any thoughts?

great progress!  I have updated the mapping tracker spreadsheet.  It's on the shared drive at G:\Shared Data Services\Projects\Q171D - CCRM Data Mart\Phase 1 - ETL Re-engineering\Development

Subject: Development status - 1/14

Adam, Seema, Beth,



Following is the status on development as of today:



A)      Monthly process:

a.       UDD to MART Mappings - We have completed development of all UDD to Mart Mappings. However since DB2 connection was not available today, we have not tested it.

b.       mSTG to UDD Mappings  We have started development of these mappings and it will be done by Friday EOD. We assume that we will have only 3 mapping for this which will in turn have multiple flows-one for each table.

c.       mSTG to MART Mappings  - We have started work on this. 2 of these mappings are 90% complete. We will send detailed status for this category tomorrow.

d.       WRK to MSTG mappings  We have checked in 6 mappings in DEV_MRT_CCRM folder. Out of this, ILS and SHEFF are ready for review.



In Short, for monthly process, we would like to recommend following due dates for development:


Activity


Original due date


Revised due date recommended


mSTG to UDD Mappings


1/19


1/16


UDD to MART Mappings    


1/26


1/16


mSTG to MART Mappings  


1/30


1/28


WRK to MSTG Mappings (all LOBs)


--


1/28

     Please note:

a.       Above dates do not include review at onsite.

b.       These dates are subject to availability of network connection and DB2 database.



B)      History process:

a.       We have completed extract of combined data (3 years data) for following LOBs: CC, BMSC, SFR. For these LOBs the extracted data contains date columns in correct format that we want (DB2 date format) and we have tested loading sample 10 records from these datasets.

b.       For remaining LOBs, scripts for extracting data are completed and we are executing them. We will be completing data extract from SAS for all LOBs latest by 1/17.

c.       We are sending a separate mail to Seema with our scripts for loading other dimensions for history (dimensions other than credit facility). Beth can use this for review / specifications for loading history if she has not yet prepared it.



Please note that because of CCRM database unavailability, we have not tested any code / SQL that we have developed today.



Adam, can you please update tracker and send it to us?



Thanks,

kishor,

As you know, Henry wants to be able to do a dry run for one appication by the end of the month.  I've made a list of the mappings that would need to be complete by that time, and made some suggested due dates.  In a nutshell, we'd like to have the orphan processing done on the 1/19 (3 mappings, pretty involved) , the udd to mart mappings (20 of them, but really simple) done on 1/26 and the final mstg to mrt mappings (five of them, pretty involved) done on the 30th.  As you get them done, we'll de doing the QA and we will of course be available to clarify anything that needs clarification. 

There are templates available for all these mappings, and the mapping documents are complete.  Development should be relatively smooth.

Do these dates seem doable to you?  If so, I'll add them to the mapping tracker document, and you can let me know what developers you'd like to assign to each one.

Shauna,

I've got the milestone dates from you for putting together this SOW in the next few weeks.  I appreciate the heads up.    I don't foresee any problem with those dates.   I would suggest that we get one other milestone in there.   On Jan 28th, we also need to have the \"scope\" finalized from CCRM perspective.   I believe they are still tossing around a few options.   I need scope settled in order to get accurate estimates into real SOW by Feb 19th.  

On another note, we will be using Praveen Bulusu as our internal Project Manager / Test Manager for phase 2.   Adam will remain and will continue with phase 1 PM role.  Phase 2 is larger than phase 1 and I need to leverage Adam's technical skills full time there.   Plus, we just want to share the PM fun with Praveen.   Praveen will begin working on phase 2 immediately and be part of the SOW development and review process.   Give me a yell if any questions.

the orphan mappings look good.  I only have one comment -
batch_id needs to go into the ins_batch_id field and the upd_batch_id.  This sounds counter-intuitive because you're actually inserting, and not updating, but it will make reporting easier... we can report on when the record was last touched using one field, instead of having to write a query that compares the insert and update batch ids.  If you can pass that on to your developers, I'd appreciate it.

The UDD to MART mappings look great.  Praveen says we should have the unit test scripts for those written next week.  As soon as they're ready, I'll let you know and we can go ahead and get the unit testing done, and I'll begin the code reviews.

Great Progress.  A few more days of this and we should be in really good shape.  If there's anything else I can do to help your guys along, let me know.

Subject: History load approach

Seema, Parag,



We are done with developing 2 SQLs for history load.

However, we are having doubt about this approach. Some of the SQLs are very large with joins of about 10 tables. For example, if D_RISK_SCORE is to be referred multiple times in fact, we will have to create as many aliases for it. I am not sure executing these complex SQLs on view containing 3 year data will be a good idea. What if the SQL fails because of database issues in between?



Let us talk about this in todays call.

I brought attention to the issue two weeks ago.  We are taking action and are targeting being back on plan by the end of next week, Jan 30th.  So far, we are making progress against the backlog.   Fortunately, the key delayed deliverable was not on the critical path although it would have eventually resulted in resource constraint.

We have discussed it today that we will be taking care of it at offshore.
Henry I am refering to smaller dimensions in History.

By doing this we will make sure we are meeting timelines.
For this, we have identified a plan and we seem to be on track for this.

Muthu,

I had the M-review with Adam Barton on GoldBank project today. So far, they have hit milestones, but are currently projecting 2 weeks behind in completing coding (scheduled for 2/27). This is due to changes in architecture that we have driven as well as things taking longer to complete offshore. The good news is they have identified it early, and are working on a recovery plan. Until we know if we can recover the time, and understand the financial impact, I would rate this as Amber. Please put this one your watch list.

Subject: Aks and Codes



I had a talk with Beth, to get some clarification about how we should be treating Aks and Codes, and what she told me is different than the way we've been handling it.



Take, for example, PROD_HIER_CD, which has 7 AK's. 

For an application that only uses 1 AK, the values should be like this:

PROD_HIER_CD = PROD_AK1
PROD_AK1 = iif(isnull(xxx), !!UNK, UPPER(xxx))
PROD_AK2 = null
PROD_AK3 = null
PROD_AK4 = null
PROD_AK5 = null
PROD_AK6 = null
PROD_AK7 = null

For an application that uses 2 AK, the values should be like this: 

PROD_HIER_CD = PROD_AK1||PROD_AK2
PROD_AK1 = iif(isnull(xxx), !!UNK, UPPER(xxx))
PROD_AK2 = iif(isnull(yyy), !!UNK, UPPER(xxx))
PROD_AK3 = null
PROD_AK4 = null
PROD_AK5 = null
PROD_AK6 = null
PROD_AK7 = null

Note:  if PROD_AK1 and PROD_AK2 are both null from the source, the resulting value for the PROD_HIER_CD will '!!UNK!!UNK', not \"!!UNK'

Anand, how do you want to handle this?  Do you want to turn the relevant AK's into variables, and then concatenate them for the codes?  Let's come up with a consistent way to do these, and then apply it to all the applications? 

Take a look at it, tell me what you think is the best way to do it, and let's make sure all the developers use it consistently.

Seema -

I'm currently working through the \"Duplicate Records in History\" file you sent - and all the the Arrangement_Ids listed below are included in this spreadsheet - except for Arrangement_Id=0.

613, 657, 658, and 674 can all be omitted/dropped as almost all of their data is NULL.

I pulled Arrangement_ID = 0 from CR_EQFIN - and there is only one record which contains mostly NULLs - it can also be omitted/dropped.

Seema,



We have total of 7 records dropping out of which 2 are because ARR_ID is null. As per Melanies mail, we can drop these records.



But for 5 records where we have valid ARR_ID, but data_date is null, we need to get data_date from Melanie.



Following are these 5 arrangement IDs for which data_date is null:

Here we see that while loading from EQFIN Full DS to fact , we are dropping 7 records,  5 because of data_date null and 2 because of arr_Id NULL.

1.) I queried table for all the records having those 5 ARR_IDs , they have only 5 instances ( coming only once) and Counterparty_Id is also not valid. So we will not be able to process these records.

2. ) For 2 records having ARR_IDs NULL , we have 1 record having valid Counterpary_Id. I then queried on all records having that counterparty ID ( last query) , here we have 2 ARR_IDs attached to that CounterParty_Id which is valid and both are coming in Oct and Nov'2008. So we need to decide which ARR_ID to take out of those 2.

So we will be able to process only 1 record out of these 7.

---> That might be left over from CLS (copy and save as defect, SBA is for CLS). There is no the logic for RAC for SBA. It will be 'U' for RAC.

2. T2.WRITE_DOWNS mapping to is null and data type is also not matching with d_cred_fclt  column UNDRWRTN. So mapped directly to NULL.

---> Should be OK since source is NULL

For Fact I will send a mail in the morning about descrepencies.(They were minor .most of the time columns which were having Null values as( data type as varchar in source )casted to null and/or converted to target column data type)

For RAC check the D_COLLATERAL - TITLED_YR has source values in RAC_TRAIN2_FULL_DS , but not flowing through MART. May be some data conversion issue..

Hi Seema,

In updated mapping sheet for dimensions , the mapping for PURPOSE HIER ( MLS ) is not in accordance with the data in dimension.

Hi Seema,

1. Fact - BHV_RSK_SCORE_ID is mapped with BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SCR_RECENT. (LEFT GRD.RSK_GRD = T2.BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SCR_RECENT).

But this field contains Scores like( 5,6, 567, 546 etc). This needsto be joined with RISK SCORE table instead of RISK GRADE.

As per the earlier discussion and the excel sheet sent by you earlier. This needs to be joined with RISK Score.

I have verfied the data in the RISK SCORE but there is no data for Issuer - TRAID.

Suggest the approach.
>> BHV_RSK_SCORE_ID should be joined to RSK_SCORE (the name was changed from GRD to SCR last week) and there is data for ISSR - TRIAD. Do you mean really mean 'TRAID'? Or you got confused with the typo that I might have done in mapping sheet?

2. RSK_GRD_ID is mapeed with CUR_RISK_GRADE.(LEFT GRD.RSK_GRD = T2.CUR_RISK_GRADE). We need to also have RSK_GRD_MDL_CD.

I have assumed to be '!' now and executed the fact query.

Suggest the join.
>>Correct. For any mapping RSK_GRD_MDL_CD has to be joined with '!'. Since we dont have any MDL identified yet.

3.Few counterpart_id's in the RAC_FULL_DS are null so they have been rejected while loading the Obligor. I have used the Left join and coalesced with -2 for these records.

>>> But you should be getting the '!!NA' record associated with 'RAC' and not just a blanket -2, so that should be an INNER JOIN to OBLGR on OBLGR_SRC_KEY = '!!NA' and SRC_STM_CD = 'RAC' 

We need to make sure for the monthly load that COUNTPTYID is translated to !!UNK/!!NA if NULL

4. For below fields data type has been changed to match target.

integer(T2.DEFAULT_FEE_PAYMENT_LTD)
integer(T2.LOSS_MITIGATION_RESERVES)
double(T2.NET_ASSET_VALUE)
integer(T2.PAYMENTS_MADE_LTD)

We did not get approval in this DP committee meeting.   Brad was not there either so it is feedback from the feedback. 


General notes:

* A lot of new executives are on board now as you know.   So even though phase 1 was sold, there is a whole new posse in town who needs to be brought up to speed..  
Kelly King
Daryl Bible
Clarke (CCRM)


* Ken Daniels is on board still and was \"blindsided\" by the lack of approval today.   He has stood up for immediate action because he does not want to \"loose this team\".   Feedback from Brad is that Ken could is \"way on board\" and this is a \"major mission\" for him. 
* \"Consulting\" has got bad connotations now.   We are not consulting and just yapping, but rather, we are their outsourcing team BUILDING this for them.   Need to reflect that on all documents.  
* Economy of course is receiving credit / blame.   Executives are sending out notes to cut expenses.  Our admin has been sending out notes on how to cut paper costs and limiting access to color printers and plotters.  There are some people missing this week.  
* The lack of success with 310 project has tarnished the image of IT projects in general.  Supposedly, there is a lot of that sentiment tied to 171D.  Business as you can imagine  is not pleased with that association. 
* They are considering putting together an executive presentation
* Speculation - Susan seemed to have knowledge ahead of time.  Does IT have concerns which are a significant obstacle
Options discussed:  

* There may be a \"few hundred\" grand to extend this team to complete all systems for Train-2 separate from phase 2.    This would give more time for the internal justification and \"sell\" of phase 2. 
* The total $2 mill phase-2 might be broken into smaller components
* Will be presented again in DP in two weeks - we need to provide some evidence
Our actions:

* We are going to show this MicroStrategy demo ASAP
* We have some historical data now in database - will consider further in association with above and what we can do  to showcase our progress.
* Sam - perhaps you could talk to Brad and see if you can contribute to executive presentation or any other area - also just to get his take personally
* We need to poll our contacts in IT to see if we can uncover any hesitation and address","2009-01-30 00:55:10""Thakur, Seema","STrivedi@GoldBank.com","[Aid4Mail Trial tag #524] About Ph 2","<6C77F18BF376964BB9B6BA3B2CE3CB4A07880CD6@clt-exmb02.Gbanknet.com>","Looks like Ph2 is not approved yet.

You have probably heard that we did not get approval on the first go round at the DP committee.   After what we went through for phase 1, it would have seemed too easy if that had happened.   Business is still committed though.   I'll forward you an email I sent to Sam on feedback from Brad.

I will make the below changes while loading the dims and fact next time.

About TRIAD and TRAID  - I got confused about the values in column  BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SOURCE_CURR which is beside the column BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SCR_RECENT and it has value TRAID.

So in case of BHV_RSK_SCORE_ID we needs to refer the issr name as TRIAD or some other generic issr.
Please confirm.

Another issue I found today is that TIMES_PST_DUE_30_59_CNT is smallint and mapped column TIME_30_DAYS_PAST_DUE contains 46 records which has values greater than 32767. Due to this records are getting rejected. I have applied the below logic.

case when TIME_30_DAYS_PAST_DUE > 32766 then 32766 else TIME_30_DAYS_PAST_DUE end
Kindly suggest

Note: I have started the load again which will finish in another 2 hrs.

Seema -

For CLS the BEHAV score is populated with our ALARM score, and for RAC it is populated with our TRIAD score.  These are both in-house custom scores - so the issuer can be something like \"CUSTOM\" or \"IN-HOUSE\" (Beth and I discussed this last Fri.).  There is no BEHAV score in SFW - so I think the issuer would be \"NA\"?

CLS:
BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SCR_RECENT = Alarm Score;                             
BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SOURCE_CURR ='ALARM';

RAC:           
BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SCR_RECENT = Triad Score;                             
BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SOURCE_CURR ='TRIAD';

SFW:
BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SCR_RECENT = NA;                             
BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SOURCE_CURR = NA;

Hi Melanie

We have these two fields from Train 2 Q310 files which derives the BHV_RSK_SCR in the mart

BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SCR_RECENT
BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SOURCE_CURR

For RAC we have valid grades and the Issuer says 'TRAID' which I assume is 'TRIAD'

But for SFW its populated with NA.
So whats actually the ISSR for BHV_RSK? Is it TRIAD or Generic (In Mart if we dont get a valid ISSR , we map it to GERERIC one.?

Hi Seema,

In updated mapping sheet for dimensions , the mapping for PURPOSE HIER ( MLS ) is not in accordance with the data in dimension.

In mapping we have mapped upper(TRIM(A.LOAN_PURPOSE_CODE)) to PURP_HIER_CD , but  data in dimension is different.
Its applicable for other columns also.


Please be informed that as of now , for other instances like this we have modified our join conditions picking up the actual data pattern in dimensions , so that records should not get dropped.

Here join condition is :-

JOIN X_HST_MRT_CCRM.D_PURPOSE_HIER PURP
on CASE WHEN UPPER(A.LOAN_PURPOSE_CODE) = 'UNKNOWN' then '!!UNKNOWN'
ELSE UPPER(A.LOAN_PURPOSE_CODE) END = PURP.PURP_DSC
AND PURP.SRC_STM_CD = 'MLS'

But we are getting cartesian product here , because for combination of 'MLS' and '!!UNKNOWN' , we have 2 records ( we should be picking up the second record having 350 as ID).

Hi Yogesh

The Join in mapping document is mentioned as

UPPER(T1.LOAN_PURPOSE_CODE) = PURP.PURP_DSC AND SRC_STM_CD = 'MLS'

Why you are putting a CASE for UNKNOWN? That is valid code coming from source. Dont confuse !!UNK with UNKNOWN.

Hi Seema,

In updated mapping sheet for dimensions , the mapping for PURPOSE HIER ( MLS ) is not in accordance with the data in dimension.

In mapping we have mapped upper(TRIM(A.LOAN_PURPOSE_CODE)) to PURP_HIER_CD , but  data in dimension is different.
Its applicable for other columns also.


Please be informed that as of now , for other instances like this we have modified our join conditions picking up the actual data pattern in dimensions , so that records should not get dropped.

Here join condition is :-

JOIN X_HST_MRT_CCRM.D_PURPOSE_HIER PURP
on CASE WHEN UPPER(A.LOAN_PURPOSE_CODE) = 'UNKNOWN' then '!!UNKNOWN'
ELSE UPPER(A.LOAN_PURPOSE_CODE) END = PURP.PURP_DSC
AND PURP.SRC_STM_CD = 'MLS'

But we are getting cartesian product here , because for combination of 'MLS' and '!!UNKNOWN' , we have 2 records ( we should be picking up the second record having 350 as ID).

For all the joins involving Risk Scores , we are facing an issue as the CURRENT_RISK_SCORE in sources is coming as 0 , but in dimension corresponding matching column is 000, so join will fail, as we are using left outer records will not get dropped but we will be populating the wrong default key corresponding to '!!UNK'.

1.)CURR_ACCNT_STATUS_ID is not applicable for EQFIN. So we are harcoding to ID corresponding to !!NA.

We are not taking ID corresponding to !!UNK.

2.)And GONE_RPT_PRD_DATE_ID as 19000101 for all LOBs.

Pls confirm it as it is only issues left with testing.



Thanks,

Yes you can truncate and all the tablespaces are ready to use.

In this Spread Sheet, you will see that I allocated almost all the spaces. 497 Gig.

I also created a two new Tablespaces called (TBLSP_CCRM2_DATA1 for the data & TBLSP_CCRM2_INDX1 for the indexes).

Now on the File system level, you have 16.3 Gig free....

While you add space to the tablespace, can we truncate and reload any of the existing tables?

Farrah should be creating us some more table space within 3 hours.   He will be letting the persons know on this email list when it is available and what the tablespace name is. 

I just talked with Farrah and we should not be expecting any interruption of availability with any of the existing tables.  i.e. we will be getting an additional tablespace as opposed to reorganizing into a new tablespace. 

Farrah will let us know of the name of the new tablespace.  

For all, there are plans of around the clock work throughout the weekend on loading of historical data.

Thanks for bringing this to notice. I will include this logic in the test cases.


The only question by any means this logic is trying o filter any records? I guess not. This is just a transformation.


This will be tested in the straight move query where we are taking the same logic what you have in code. This is based on the assumption that for such smaller transformations you have the correct logic. As we do not have mapping documents updated we need to trust the code here. We dont have any other document which says these fields will be coded like this only. We also test fields like ACT_INACT_FLG, ACT_INACT_CHG_IND etc fields using the code only.

Praveen/Parag >> Please let me know if this is OK? Or should we test these fields separately. Anyways we include this code in the data compare query.

Subject: SFW History Load

I am sending my queries for the SFW history load.  I am having issues
keeping a connection while it runs.  I am hoping that you guys can kick
it off and let me know if you run into any issues.

D_Collateral has been loaded. 

D_Cred_Fclt needs to be loaded, then D_Obligor and finally F_Cred_Fclt.

I really appreciate it.  If anything errors, just let me know and I will
fix any issues.  I just need someone to kick it off.

The only thing I will need you guys to do on these queries is fix the
file path for the message log for the Cursors, because I am not sure
what the correct file path is from where you guys run the script.
Please let me know if there is anything you need from me.  I will be
online tonight and through the weekend, so anything you guys need that I
can assist on let me know.

If you look in the F_CRED_FCLT load you will see the first query loads a
table called WRK_AR_EVER_DFP, this is to get the EVER flags for the fact
table.

All,

Following is the status of regression testing for the defect fixes.

* EFS 100% complete. The defect fixes were regression tested twice as there were some defects after the second load too.
* ILS - 80% complete - We are waiting for the ILS data load again to test the defects.
* SHF - 80%complete - We are waiting for the SHF data load again to test the defects.
* RAC - 30% complete - Testing for for d_cred_faclt is 100% done. Development team is still working on loading the f_cred_faclt. We will start testing both  d_cred_faclt and f_cred_faclt as soon as the load is complete.
* DEP - 30% complete - Testing for for d_cred_faclt is 100% done. Development team is still working on loading the f_cred_faclt. We will start testing both  d_cred_faclt and f_cred_faclt for DEP as soon as the load is complete.
Attached is the updated defect log as of Jan 31st. We will update the status of these defects in the issues database on Monday.

Hey,

Think about it like this. 

All application code are the same for the input table  - one column in group by. 

The other column in group by is arrangement-id.  

So by definition, only one row is going to be returned for an any particular arrangement_id.   The rest are max / min.  Group by is going to ensure that arrangement_id is unique.  


We need a row for every month for every arrangement_id.   The \"ever\" status could change from month to month.   So this query which returns only one row per arrangement cannot possibly indicate the \"ever\" status for each and every month.

Following is one of the options that we tested for EVER calculation.
In this we are Concatenating 'Z' to the Flag and data date and then taking the max in the AR_MAX table itself.

Suggest that you run your loads on smaller subsets of data to speed development cycle.   Where data_date > October 2008 for example.  You may already be doing this though.  

Praveen, 

Do you have a test that compares column by column against history and mart?   We don't need to test the entire dataset but could pick specific rows by arrangement_id to compare column by column.

All,

Following is the status of regression testing for the defect fixes.

* EFS 100% complete. The defect fixes were regression tested twice as there were some defects after the second load too.
* ILS - 80% complete - We are waiting for the ILS data load again to test the defects.
* SHF - 80%complete - We are waiting for the SHF data load again to test the defects.
* RAC - 30% complete - Testing for for d_cred_faclt is 100% done. Development team is still working on loading the f_cred_faclt. We will start testing both  d_cred_faclt and f_cred_faclt as soon as the load is complete.
* DEP - 30% complete - Testing for for d_cred_faclt is 100% done. Development team is still working on loading the f_cred_faclt. We will start testing both  d_cred_faclt and f_cred_faclt for DEP as soon as the load is complete.
Attached is the updated defect log as of Jan 31st. We will update the status of these defects in the issues database on Monday.

Thank you,

All the tables creation and dim load scripts  for BMSC have been created pls find them as attachment.


1) f_bmsc_table.sql and d_bmsc_table.sql tables scripts have references to separate tablespace name TBLSP_CCRM2_DATA1 for creating tables in different tablespace.

only two indexes will be created in these two tables. (Primary and Unique).

2) All other dimension tables scripts for BMSC (i.e oblgr, collateral and max ar) have created as it is,  means it is using TBLSP_CCRM_DATA1 tablespace.

3) I was not able to delete existing table already created  for BMSC due to \"database log full...\".

4) Except fact load  scripts for BMSC, all other are completed.

Tables creation scripts =>

<<d_coll_bmsc_table.sql>> <<d_bmsc_table.sql>> <<f_bmsc_table.sql>> <<d_oblgr_bmsc_table.sql>> <<d_max_bmsc_table.sql>>



Dim load scripts =>

<<d_cred_fclt_bmsc.sql>> <<d_coll_bmsc.sql>> <<d_max_arr_bmsc.sql>> <<d_oblgr_bmsc.sql>>

Later we will change the table reference from BMSC to BMSR so same scripts can be used for BMSR.

I have looked at the test logs given by Mahesh , I did the testing on all open issues in SHEFF and according to me there was only 1 issue outstanding from our side of PROD_ID in dim and fact. All other issues are fine. I have made changes in both dim and fact script after the analysis of issue and placed on path below mentioned. So you can run it. PROD_Idjoin is modified, after loading both tables we can give it for retesting.



I have also made changes in SFR dim script because of wrong value coming from source in integer field. You can run it for SFR also.

ILS flow :-
DROP INDEX as both fact and dim are in tablespace data1 ( hv created a script)
1.sfr dim
2.sfr fact
3.drl dim ( with insert option )
4.drl fact  ( with insert option )



I am also putting up the MLS scripts for running. Here data is loaded in all arr_max, fact and dim as of now.
Here we need to drop and recreate the arr_max table( varchar 20 for flags) , run the new arr max script with new logic for ever flags.

Then I am attaching the drop index for exitsing _MLS fact and dim which are in daat1 tablespace. You need to execute them.

Then load the dim and fact.  If any isse comes here you can call me.
PLS CHECK THE INSER AND REPLACE FO SFR AND DRL according to sequence you are running


PATH :-   /bdw_dev/ebdw/data/src/wrk/cred_fclt
All changed and new  scripts ( drl dim , drl fact and sfr fact have not been changed)

create_max_mls.txt  --> drop and recraete new max table for MLS ( copy nad paste it in Toad , will not run in UNIX)
d_max_arr_mls.sql ---> max script for mls with changed ever logic
drop_index_mls.ksh  --> drop index for MLS
f_crd_fclt_mls.sql  --> new script
d_crd_fclt_mls.sql ---> new script
drop_index_ils.ksh  --> drop index for ILS
d_crd_fclt_sfr.sql --> changed script for sfr dim,
d_cred_fclt_shf.sql --> changed script after 1 change of prod_id after testing

Henry,



As per DataTech policies, each project is allocated a Quality Lead.

For GoldBank we previously had a QL who was based in US and used to interact with Adam.



Now we have Ramesh Nikam as QL who will be working from Mumbai.

His role will be helping us review processes, publish quality reports and help for CMMI.



He will be billing maximum 4 hours per week (non billable-will not be charged to client).



Can you please confirm if he can charge maximum of 4 hours per week to US_Gbank008?



Thanks,

Henry,



We discussed with Adam and Praveen about testing dates and our understanding is as follows:



History:

1. Data will be prepared in development and we will just move data to TEST instead of executing all load jobs in TEST.
2. TEST box is not yet ready and Adam will confirm when do we need to migrate data to TEST
3. As of today we have completed loading of history for 7 LOBs and will be loading remaining 4 (including PRIME & SFW) by tomorrow EOD.
4. Testing team is testing LOBs which we have already completed. By Wednesday, we will start reloading data to resolve issues.


Monthly Process:

1. Date for migration to SIT is 2/27.
2. We have some questions and issues in executing ILS end to end. We are sending detailed mail about this.


Can you please let us know your thoughts on this?



Thanks,

For GoldBank we previously had a QL who was based in US and used to interact with Adam.



Now we have Ramesh Nikam as QL who will be working from Mumbai.

His role will be helping us review processes, publish quality reports and help for CMMI.



He will be billing maximum 4 hours per week (non billable-will not be charged to client).



Can you please confirm if he can charge maximum of 4 hours per week to US_Gbank008?



Thanks,

Here are the codes from MVS which are from History , but not from HUB
 << File: MVS DESC.xls >>

Also you can check the scripts for D_LOB_HIER. They are all complete and tested. D_LOB_HIER is ready to go.
I had to add one more AK in CLS and ILS , because these two are segmented further into LOB's.
So the combination of AK was not unique across unless we added 'ORIGINAL_LOB_INDICATOR'.

For e.g ILS - Composition derives SFR as well as DRL so we need ORIGINAL_LOB_INDICATOR , which is 'SF' and 'DRL'   to make it unique..

Check the data loaded in UDD..

LOB_HIER_CD,                    SRC_STM_CD,                     LOB_AK1,                LOB_AK2
5130~DRL,                       ILS,                            5130,                   DRL
5130~SF,                        ILS,                            5130,                   SF

For CLS , since there is are just 4 AK's. I concatenated the PURPOSE CODE and make it as 1 AK. Since the puprpose code (P1 or P2) is not deriving it.. Its always P1 and P2 together.

Thanks & Regards

Although we have prepopulated prod_hier for mvs with codes from hub, there are still about 50 odd descriptions coming from history which does not have a code.

How do we push that in dimension..
Cant make DESC as AK / CD because its > 10 char

Do we put 'HIST' as 'AK1'  and match with DESC ?

But BANKRUPTCY_SCORE has NULL for all fields in PRIME. I had a look at the Monthly mapping for Prime to know that this field will be coming in Monthly or NOT, its mapped there( in future we will be getting values) , so I am putting '!!UNK' there instead of '!!NA' to be consistent with Monthly.

For pulling  fact field BCN_RSK_SCORE_ID in mapping there has join mentioned , but no info is given , I had a look at monthly maaping for this field , it '!!NA'  , there so pulling ID corresponding to '!!NA'.

We confirmed this with monthly WRK-to-STG mapping. I think we need to get it confirmed from Seema/Beth if there is some doubt.

1.) In mapping for F_CRED_FCLT_MTH, HFS_TOB ( date) from PRIME_FULL_DS  is mapped to HLD_FOR_SALE_TOB_CNT( smallint) , as data is not coming in this particualr field so , I have converted it to integer and ran SQL. Had it been some valid data in this field , we would have faced issues as target field is count field. Need to take care of this in monthly.

  0 record(s) selected.

F_PRIME_MTH

2.) In mapping for F_PRIME_MTH , we are not having source field for FIN_AMT_SGMT . I had a look at the old LGRED_to_CCRM_V2.xls and there I got source field as AMOUNT_FINANCED. So in SQL have taken this field.



3.) LATE_CHARGE_FLAG from prime_full_ds  is being mapped to LATE_CRG_FLG in F_PRIME_MTH. But values are coming as 0 and 1 , in mapping its a straight move, but I have chganged 0 to N and 1 to Y

  2 record(s) selected.




4.)AMOUNT_PMTS_AGG(double)  is being mapped to PYMT_AGG_CNT(smallint) , we are getting around 37807 records getting rejected because of data truncation , so as of now , we have loaded this field as > 32,767 then  NULL. We need to increase the range in target table to accommodate all the  values. Max value that smallint can accommodate is  (-32,767 to +32,767 ) .  We can see that max values is exceeding this limit.

  1 record(s) selected.







5.)ORIGINAL_LTV_RATIO(double) is being ammped to ORG_LTV_RATIO( decimal(8,5) ), but as we see below there are records for which we have data larger than that ( decimal (8,5) can take max of 3 places before decimal and we have 4 places before decimal) , so 11 records are getting rejected because of this. We need to increase the range in target table to accommodate all the  values.  as of now , we have loaded this field as > 999.99999 then  NULL

We are almost at the end of project. Development activities will be over in next 2 weeks and we will be in SIT / UAT for 1 more month.

We will not have time to implement any new processes that we add.



However, your valuable help in setting up processes and audit will be very helpful in phase 2 of the project which is likely to start in April.



Considering this, do you think we should start implementing QL support from phase 2 of the project?

There was only 1 issue in PRIME because of the EVER falg( no issue in coding) , but there was copy paste issue as bkrpt was maaped to default and vice versa. So I hv changed the code and re run it. So we are good with all 3 tables of PRIME. Mahesh is raising the 2 issues there to BUSINESS ( 2 fileds where we coded NULL if > max values as in my yesterday's mail).


ILS dim and fact hv been reloaded but there is 1 issue pending ( we changed coalesce to !!UNK from !!NA  as given in SIT sheet but there was 1 more issue which I got just now , as we are doing join _CD but we have to take _DSC ) as I was testing all the issues before releasing data to testing team.

Thanks for the follow up. 

That agrees with the results that Doug H. is finding. 

I agree that IT should proceed with the planned changes.

The million dollar question for the short term is do we have enough of a problem to take dramatic steps and perhaps impact $ and time?

Do we know the answer to that?   Do we know the amount of effort it would take to answer that question. 

We have a plan that we are formalizing, but we are taking no action.  We are going to wrap up the coding phase in the next week.   Perhaps, we'll be able to gather some more information between now and then to help.   We should be in a state next week where we can do some comparisons of key columns to get a feel.

Subject:        FW: NULL Values and 0s

Hey there -

I think this solves this mystery as to why we're seeing the discrepancy between our SAS datasets and the HUB for CLS.  The SAS Train 2 extract code was setting 0 values to NULL - don't know why (???). 

For example - FLOOR is being set to NULL if it is not greater than 0:
IF CL55_FLOOR_RATE > 0 THEN                                                    
    FLOOR=CL55_FLOOR_RATE; 

I don't have access to the source data for any of the other systems to be able to do comparisons (ie. ILS, MLS) - I only have access to our SAS data.  Any ideas on how to get Doug some other examples?  I think we need to move forward with the proposed solution regardless.


Sorry for all of the confusion - I'll take the hit for this one!

Yes..numeric fields should always have a value.  Numeric fields have to be initialized to 0 when first created.

Hi Laura -

Quick question for you

Do you know if most of the files on CLS (i.e. Note Master File) apply a rule regarding zeroes and nulls for numeric fields.  I'm not seeing any nulls in most numeric fields - there is either a 0 or a different value.  Just wondering if this is the rule numeric fields will always contain either a 0 or another numeric value.


Thanks for your help!

Morning Kollie -

Hope you're well this morning!

We're trying to determine the impact of some rules being applied to numeric fields in the HUB.  Do you know how the bankcard system handles zeros and nulls for numeric fields?  For example, are all numeric fields initialized to 0 to ensure they will always contain a value and never be Null - or can numeric fields contain Nulls?

Morning Jennifer -

Quick question for you

Do you know if the ILS system applies a rule regarding zeroes and nulls for numeric fields?  For example, are all numeric fields initialized to 0 to ensure they will always contain a value and never be Null - or can we see Nulls in numeric fields?


Thanks,

Look at RMBP3200.   When converting a new client we initialize the RMBP3000 (Master) with this record.   You will notice that this record contains the group names for some fields to initialize them to spaces.   I dont know of any RMBP3000 fields that would contain Null values (low-values) or uninitialized value.  



Some numeric fields are not initialized to zeros because some of our programs will detect the zeros as a value and thus execute paragraphs for that field when it should not execute.   So spaces within a numeric field is not wrong.   Those will probably be included in RMBP3300 within their respective group names.



I hope this helps.

Are all numeric fields initialized to 0 to ensure they will always contain a value and never be Null - or can numeric fields contain Nulls?

Brad is out through Monday and I need his support.   Soonest that I can deal with this with IT then is Tuesday.  It will be a sell to get them to do it.   If we had to do it all ourselves, would we still choose Mini Hub?   Meaning that we add an extra layer to our architecture and the first thing we do is to load the flat file into our own Mini Hub.

For the approach we are going to suggest, we have basically the same work.  We have to change datatypes and do some extra editing. 

Difference is that we ask IT to go ahead and load these flat files into the \"mini hub\"

Advantages are:

1) We salvage all of the SIT table to table test scripts for Hub -> WRK. 

2) the \"undo\" task when they implement the new hub architecture is minimized. 

3) all work they do is reusable because it is the new architecture 



Anand will appreciate this.   What they are going to do is completely throw away all STG, PUB, CEL code from all hub applications and replace it with a DBIMPORT load script.  All of it to be tossed.   What is that?  A million dollars thrown away not one year later.     

It is going to  take them some time to replace it.  Even with just a DBIMPORT.  Therefore, they have tried to unload all of the work upon us to just source from the landed flat files.  Our propoal, we believe is the least amount of overall work, has the best chance of not increasing $, and involves minimal rework.   All we need to get is some IT involvement.    



 If I was an I told you so guy, I would pull out my email from December 2006 before it all began.  In it I said it was a mistake and do it as they have, and recommended that they do what they come to more than one year later.

So far, it seems that we are finding that most numeric fields from the source do not contain nulls.   True?    It seems that the more we dig, the lesser the potential problem becomes.  

Still, I don't believe that this should be done in the Hub and IT has plans to remove this processing from the Hub.  But do we need to risk delivery now?

I don't think we really understand the impact (if any?) of this yet.   

Really, it won't be apparent until reports are created.  Have you gus started on any of this?   If we had a sample of a few reports with potential problems and you could give us the business rules, we could create SQL to pull back the data to see what the impact is.

That's what it sounds like to me and sometimes we have to check for numeric fields.  This is where you can look for the copybooks.

Look at RMBP3200.   When converting a new client we initialize the RMBP3000 (Master) with this record.   You will notice that this record contains the group names for some fields to initialize them to spaces.   I dont know of any RMBP3000 fields that would contain Null values (low-values) or uninitialized value.  



Some numeric fields are not initialized to zeros because some of our programs will detect the zeros as a value and thus execute paragraphs for that field when it should not execute.   So spaces within a numeric field is not wrong.   Those will probably be included in RMBP3300 within their respective group names.



I hope this helps.

Cindy,

Are all numeric fields initialized to 0 to ensure they will always contain a value and never be Null - or can numeric fields contain Nulls?

Do you know if the mortgage loan system (mainframe file) applies a rule regarding zeros and nulls for numeric fields?  For example, are all numeric fields initialized to 0 to ensure they will always contain a value and never be Null - or can numeric fields contain Nulls?

The main system I was concerned about was CLS because we were getting so much more data (Train 2).  But we now know all numerics are initialized to 0 on CLS.  For the other core bank systems - ILS - MLS - Bankcard - we're only implementing Train 1 as part as phase 1, and this data includes very few numeric fields - most of which we verified today do not have Nulls.

Melanie, Brad, 

So far, it seems that we are finding that most numeric fields from the source do not contain nulls.   True?    It seems that the more we dig, the lesser the potential problem becomes.  

Still, I don't believe that this should be done in the Hub and IT has plans to remove this processing from the Hub.  But do we need to risk delivery now?

I don't think we really understand the impact (if any?) of this yet.   

Really, it won't be apparent until reports are created.  Have you gus started on any of this?   If we had a sample of a few reports with potential problems and you could give us the business rules, we could create SQL to pull back the data to see what the impact is.

Hi Kim -

I'm down to inquiring about specific fields and this Null/Space issue (probably what you were trying to get to this morning!).  I've attached the program that extracts the data for us from the mortgage loan system - and have highlighted in yellow 4 fields for which I would like to know whether or not they can ever contain a null/space.  Unfortunately, I don't have access to the mainframe copybooks.

Fields highlighted in yellow on attached document:
* FIRST_PRIN_BAL
* BAD_CK_TABLE
* PROPERTY_VALUE
* PERCENTAGE

Thanks for your help - and please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: RE: Mortgage System - Zeros and Nulls

Look at RMBP3200.   When converting a new client we initialize the RMBP3000 (Master) with this record.   You will notice that this record contains the group names for some fields to initialize them to spaces.   I dont know of any RMBP3000 fields that would contain Null values (low-values) or uninitialized value.  



Some numeric fields are not initialized to zeros because some of our programs will detect the zeros as a value and thus execute paragraphs for that field when it should not execute.   So spaces within a numeric field is not wrong.   Those will probably be included in RMBP3300 within their respective group names.



I hope this helps.

Cindy,

Are all numeric fields initialized to 0 to ensure they will always contain a value and never be Null - or can numeric fields contain Nulls?

Do you know if the mortgage loan system (mainframe file) applies a rule regarding zeros and nulls for numeric fields?  For example, are all numeric fields initialized to 0 to ensure they will always contain a value and never be Null - or can numeric fields contain Nulls?

Lets follow these guidelines while test execution. Please go through these.



Test execution flow:

1)     Correct the syntax errors in the test SQLs. You can use Toad/Control Center for this.

2)     Create a <Test-case-number>.sql file on UNIX.

3)     Run the sql using DB2 command prompt and redirect its output to .txt file.

4)     If the output does not match with expected output -

a.      Check you are using correct tables or not.

b.      Check the conditions used in the WHERE clause are correct or not.

c.      Check the columns used in the SELECT clause are in correct sequence and are compatible w.r.t. Data type and length.

d.      Check the logic is as per the mapping document or not.

e.      Validate the logic manually for 1 or 2 records.

f.       If need be open the code and confirm the logic is in sync with document or not. This step is not required and should be very last option. Do not consider code as final or correct if test case is not working and/or there is mismatch between code and the document.

g.      Raise the defect in the SIT defect log. Let only one person manage the defect log.

5)     If the output matches with expected output 

a.      Check you are using correct tables or not.

b.      Check the conditions used in the WHERE clause are correct or not.

c.      Check the logic is as per the mapping document or not.

d.      If its a except query try running the queries separately and confirm that you are getting correct output.

6)     If still in doubt or not clear why the test case is failed or successful, discuss the same within the testing team and decide whether it should be raised as defect or requires more clarification from the business. In either case we will put this in the SIT defect log.

7)     We need to collect output for both successful and failed test case. The output will act as the evidence. We should always validate our test case written correctly or not.

8)     Feel free to add or to collect more outputs for the justification of the defect/test case.

9)     Download all the output files from UNIX to the shared drive.

10) Important: Update the test case document with modified SQL and write the status in the Actual result column.

11) Once the data is reloaded we will only test the cases which were failed. And few common cases like count and straight moves again.



Praveen/Parag> kindly add any more points or correct these.

All,

I've just been told by Kenny Shore that our Informatica code will now go through an eight day request / implementation cycle much like the DPSRs for the database now do.  I've also been told that we cannot \"anticipate\" this readiness.   i.e. we cannot anticipate that the code will be fully  tested and ready eight days from now and submit the request.  The code will actually have to be frozen for eight days without updates or it will not be moved. 

The impact is that we add an eight day task between SIT test completion and Production migration.  This is an extra eight days in the plan.  

Susan, 

You can confirm if this your understanding.  I expect that there will be questions from the business side.

Seems like the loading and transformation of historical SAS datasets into the HST tables is something we could get a head start on.   When do you want to start that?  The answer is Monday when the box is available:) 

I am talking about loading over to the TEST box now.  

We are not going to move anything other than our initially populated dimensions from DEV to TEST.   DEV has had too many restarts to completely trust the data.  


There will be many more controls on who can access and run jobs on the TEST box.

I need the following questions answered. 


1) Are you going to need to rerun the SAS extraction code that writes out the delimited files?  i.e. did you save the previous results?

2) What was the target (computer destination) for the initial delimited files?  What server and directory?

3) Was a movement of the data then required?  From the server / directory in 2)  to what server and directory???

4) Then there was a DBIMPORT to the database I understand.   We need these scripts.  

5)  We need a \"run book\".   What are each of the scripts that need to be run and what order.  

6) How long did this all run?

7) What kind of space was consumed?

We need all of this answered in order to: 1) ensure our TEST environment is set up correctly and 2) define and review the process we are going to go through for test.  As you know, there will be much stricter control on who has access on/

I still have big concerns for when we bring the History and Monthly datasets together and find the places where we have been inconsistent.  As well as making sure we have all these history data issues dealt with particular with some of the runs times we get.

I think if we have one or two sources where we feel the code and the data is solid, then we start migrating a couple of systems at a time.  This way loads and testing can begin for those as the rest of the data issues get ironed out.

So what I see here is that with the exception of Sheffield, all of these have defects serious enough to require one more reload and test cycle prior to being ready for the TEST environment.   ILS and CLS are behind that.  

The original migration of history to SIT was to occur 1/9.   We are now one month late and counting.   If it runs into next week, we will start delaying the monthly testing because history has to be there and finished for proper SIT testing in monthly.   Every set of republished dates so far has slipped also.    

I'm hearing confidence, but the facts aren't backing that up.  What is the honest assessment here?  Let's hear from everyone.

Henry,

Here is the current history testing status. We need to run CLS, ILS and re-test defect fixes. Attached is the issue log but I think some of these are closed. I can send you the updated list by tomorrow morning.

We also need some measurements on response time.   We don't know anything about this test box.   If we get over there and things run much slower, we won't have any leverage unless we have definitive measures to compare against in TEST.

I think for at least some of this time can be attributed to finding problems with there SAS datasets.  I believe at least a three Systems have required full history reruns with corrections, not including some of the systems where Melanie is manually correcting data.  Unfortunately much of the data was not nearly as conformed as we originally thought.  One could argue that we should have found these data issues earlier in the process, but we can't change that now.

I still have big concerns for when we bring the History and Monthly datasets together and find the places where we have been inconsistent.  As well as making sure we have all these history data issues dealt with particular with some of the runs times we get.

I think if we have one or two sources where we feel the code and the data is solid, then we start migrating a couple of systems at a time.  This way loads and testing can begin for those as the rest of the data issues get ironed out.

Yes, sheffield is the only LOB that was 100% done and we can add MVS to that list as well. We still need to test the LOAN_TP_ID in EFS to call it 100% done.

Also, the plan is to test the monthly data load on top of the history data in the SIT phase. Do you suggest we do the same in DEV as well?

The test team has completed regression testing for MVS. We can call this a 100% done. Also, we received an email from Yogesh a few minutes back saying that PRT and LFS LOBs are reloaded and we will start the regression testing for these LOBs as well.

Yes, sheffield is the only LOB that was 100% done and we can add MVS to that list as well. We still need to test the LOAN_TP_ID in EFS to call it 100% done.

Also, the plan is to test the monthly data load on top of the history data in the SIT phase. Do you suggest we do the same in DEV as well?

I think for at least some of this time can be attributed to finding problems with there SAS datasets.  I believe at least a three Systems have required full history reruns with corrections, not including some of the systems where Melanie is manually correcting data.  Unfortunately much of the data was not nearly as conformed as we originally thought.  One could argue that we should have found these data issues earlier in the process, but we can't change that now.

I still have big concerns for when we bring the History and Monthly datasets together and find the places where we have been inconsistent.  As well as making sure we have all these history data issues dealt with particular with some of the runs times we get.

I think if we have one or two sources where we feel the code and the data is solid, then we start migrating a couple of systems at a time.  This way loads and testing can begin for those as the rest of the data issues get ironed out.

So what I see here is that with the exception of Sheffield, all of these have defects serious enough to require one more reload and test cycle prior to being ready for the TEST environment.   ILS and CLS are behind that.  

The original migration of history to SIT was to occur 1/9.   We are now one month late and counting.   If it runs into next week, we will start delaying the monthly testing because history has to be there and finished for proper SIT testing in monthly.   Every set of republished dates so far has slipped also.    

I'm hearing confidence, but the facts aren't backing that up.  What is the honest assessment here?  Let's hear from everyone.

Here is the current history testing status. We need to run CLS, ILS and re-test defect fixes. Attached is the issue log but I think some of these are closed. I can send you the updated list by tomorrow morning.

I would not think that any modification of data for SIT History testing should be necessary.  We are not trying to verify Insert/Update/CDC for the History data.  And this is just 1 load.  This should all be about the results of the data being in the correct columns, records counts, and amount sums.

Praveen, are you guys planning on something more?

Praveen,

There is the thought that we will lift up the historical data from TEST and just move it to PROD after our testing is complete.  However, is that possible?   Do some of your tests actually modify the data?

I think I know the answer to this, but for your #2 below, was that 114 weeks all allocated to offshore and build / testing?   Or did that include onshore analysis / coordination / SIT / migration also?

Henry,



Following are my comments:



1. I am OK with your estimate for CLS expansion. We have worked it out separately and it comes close to your estimate. I am sending you a separate mail about CLS estimation.
2. My estimate of 114 weeks for Train 2 was without any buffer / consideration for approval / follow up with CCRM. It will be good to increase this estimate by 10%
3. Is reporting included in any of the following estimates? I dont see it as a separate item. Can you please check estimate for reporting?
4. I have a suggestion about onsite team.
	1. I am assuming that Report Analyst mentioned by you will play role of onsite coordinator for reporting team.
	2. Our total estimate for offshore effort is 17790 hours (This will go up slightly if we agree to increase Train 2 estimates)
	3. This translates to 444 man weeks. If we assume project life cycle of 5 months (20 weeks), this effort is 23 offshore resources.
	4. General norm is that 1 onsite coordinator should coordinate work for at most 7 offshore resources. It can go up to 8-9 if requirements are completely frozen. Going by this, we will need 3 dedicated onsite coordinators.
	5. Looking at this from another angle, we have 6 different sub projects and having just 2 onsite coordinators (1 ONC & 1 reporting coordinator) will be a risk.
	6. Summarizing this, I suggest following onsite team:
                                                               i.      Solution Architect

                                                             ii.      ETL architect / modeler

                                                            iii.      Project Manager

                                                            iv.      Test Manager

                                                              v.      Report analyst / Onsite coordinator for reporting

                                                            vi.      Onsite coordinator for Train 2 expansion & CLS expansion. These 2 systems are closely related to phase 1 and some one with phase 1 experience can play this role.

                                                           vii.      Onsite coordinator number 2 for any 2 other sub projects

                                                         viii.      Onsite coordinator number 3 for remaining 2 sub projects

If required, to achieve better cost leverage, we can have Onsite coordinators start on the project after 1 month (i.e. after requirement gathering is partially complete) though we should try to start ONCs from day 1. Also, depending on our comfort level with correctness of requirements, we can look at clubbing ONC 2 and ONC 3 into a single role.



Let us discuss this tomorrow during our weekly call.

4) There is concern at GoldBank about real estate - both commercial and retail.   If someone has some ideas on how we might mine that information out and find a few nuggets, that could potentially be a huge sale. 

5) Melanie has some standard reports that could be reproduced.

6) We have a potential brainstorming session with Brad, Sam, Santosh, others to create some more report ideas.  

7) We can't interfere with phase 1 delivery - the current onshore and offshore team is slammed.   I'll be able to make some cycles.  

8) We need a database.   Right now, the portfolios in development are spread across individual tables.   We'll have to figure out how we can bring this data together in DEV so that we have something to base all of this on.

This is a summary of things we went over in meeting today.  Let me know if additions or corrections.  

We have a few prerequisite tasks that need to be performed on the CCRMTEST / BDWTEST boxes.  All need to be complete by Feb 16th.  

1) Final userid setup with profiles, etc.
  ** Doug Hodges coordinates

2) Allocate Space
    ** kishor to provide space requirements
    ** Doug Hodges to work space with UNIX support after requirements are known

3) Establish 3 permission groups on two databases for userids that currently exist on CCRMDEV
    a) ETLLOAD - all authority CCRMTEST and BDWTEST
    b) TESTERS - Read only in CCRMTEST, Read only in BDWTEST except write in ETL and WRK schemas
    c) DEVELOPERS - Read only in CCRMTEST, Read only in BDWTEST
    ** Doug to coordinate this with UNIX and Farah
    ** Henry to supply userid list and groups. 

4) Configure SAS server for access to all environments
   ** Melanie will coordinate

Approximate sequence of events of SIT / UAT in TEST   -- Begins now and runs three weeks

1) Load TEST UDD from unload of DEV UDD - Insert into scripts
2) Load mart dimensions from UDD with scripts 
2) Run SAS programs to create delimited datasets back to SAS server
3) Transfer delimited datasets to CCRMTEST
5) Run the History Loads
6) Execute SIT/UAT
7) Approval - test is now ready for first Informatica monthly load
8) At this point, the historical data is completely loaded and approved.
9) Backup and redirected restore of CCRMTEST data to CCRMPROD
    ** Doug to coordinate this with DBA group
10) PROD will be loaded with the migrated data and ready for first Informatica monthly load

I will need to know some measures


1) how much space you will need to transfer the largest historical file - by itself - pass files through one at a time and delete


2) how much space you would need to transfer the entire suite of historical file  - hold them all together at once

Another option we may have to consider is transferring to Informatica box which has a landing zone of considerable size.  This will require an extra network hop for the dbiimport of course.

OBLGR/COLLATERAL/ARR_MAX :-

1. target table is only 1 for all these 3 tables ( not LOB specific)
2. only insert option selected ( no replace even in first)
3. statistics option to be removed as its incompatible with Load insert
4. to check whether we have ARRANGEMENT_ID is NOT NULL , COUNTERPARTY_ID is NOT NULL in all respective scripts ( whichever is applicable), as it might not be consistent, different ppl have made them.
5. to take care of COLLATREAL in case of TRAIN2 as mappings have changed and now some fields have to be mapped( REVIEW)
6. To take care how train1 and train2 is handled( RAC, CLS and SFW)
7. for train 2 , no we need to take INNER as opposed to LEFT OUTER that we have taken.
8. Log file names to be consistent ( 1 for each table)
9. To check that select clause have been mapped to correct insert clause ( issue we had where ever_dflt was mapped to ever_bkrpt) , typo issues.
10. In MAX table clause HAVING MAX(sb.DATA_DATE) IS NOT NULL should be there.
11. We might need to make change in ARR_MAX logic if U is coming in source than its mapped to N. Will explore this point as any changes are required or the current code is accommodating this.


For tables in SIT BOX :-

1.All indexes and constraints are proper before proceeding with loading.

2.We need to give DDL to DBA for ARR_MAX table as he will not be creating that as part of schema .

3.We need to give DDL for all HISTORY tables as date columns have been changed from INT to DATE( we can have index on data_date and arrangement_ID, as of now we dont have.)

4. To check with Beth whether the 12 HISTORY tables will be in a different schema or the MRT_CCRM.





I am working on checklist for D_CRED_FCLT, F_CRED_FCLT and F_PRIME_MTH and will share the same. Will also add some points to above ones as I remember those according to issues faced.



Pls add if you think some more points can be covered.

See attached spreadsheets for sizing of all SAS datasets.   In short, we need about 100 Gig to hold everything.   At minimum, we would want about 25 gig, but that would require a lot of swap-in, swap-out.  

I see that this was not a problem in DEV because we were sharing the box with Informatica and used its landing zone.   On the test box, we don't have anything like that.   Not nearly enough space to move even single files. 

We are ready to start now:)

Shauna, Doug,

The set up of the interim CCRMTEST box has been marked complete for many weeks now.   Unfortunately, we have come to know when we needed it that even though there may have been a box, it was empty and unusable.  

I can take a hit for making the assumption that the box being there meant it was ready to use. 

But what is important no is that we get this ready ASAP.   It is delaying us as I write this. We could be moving history files.  As of Monday, February 16th, it will absolutely be in the critical path and every day delay will move the entire project.   This is listed as a project risk. 

Some progress has been made - a database has been installed on the box and tables have been created. 

Left to be done:

Userids and proper environment need to be established
Permissions on database need to be established
File space needs to be established
Perhaps more?  


I believe I have provided all of the needed information.  In a nutshell, we need everything that we have in the DEV environment.   Please let me know if you need additional information.  


Adam is following up with the Informatica environment where we may have some other opportunities.

Hi,


1.)For pulling CURR_PURP_HIER_ID in RAC, we have join on

UPPER(T2.LOAN_PURPOSE_CODE) = PURP.PURP_HIER_CD AND SRC_STM_CD = 'RAC'.


Shall we pick up LOAN_PURPOSE_CODE from T1 or T2.Pls confirm.

Use Tain2 LOAN_PUROSE_CODE

Adam,  this needs to be updated in the monthly mapping document for RAC.  Right now it says PURPOSE_HIER_CD/PURP_AK1 should be RAC, but they should come from LOAN_PURPOSE_CODE from the WRK table

2.)For pulling LOAN _TP_ID in EQFIN, we have join on


JOIN X_HST_MRT_CCRM.D_LOAN_TYPE LOAN
LOAN.LOAN_TP_DSC = T1.UPPER(TYPE_OF_LOAN) AND LOAN.SRC_STM_CD = 'EFS'

Need to use BUSINESS LINE and  not TYPE_OF_LOAN, that would need to be updated in the History mapping for CRED_FCLT
The monthly mapping also needs to be updated and get loan type from UDF_BROKER_DEALER_CODE column


And value we are getting from source is

[etlload@wil-etldev02]/bdw_dev/ebdw/data/src/wrk/cred_fclt>db2 \" select distinct TYPE_OF_LOAN from X_HST.EQFIN_FULL_DS \"

TYPE_OF_LOAN
-------------------------
Business
-

  2 record(s) selected.

Earlier it was running fine, but now after we made change in the D_LOAN_TYPE  dimension LFS changed to EFS and vice versa, our this join is now failing as we are not getting a match for BUSINESS in LOAN_TYPE dimension for EFS. So we need to make changes in dimension.

One of the goals will be to keep our core team in place for several months while BGoldBank is working out the financials.   We'll have to cut our team to 1/2 the size of its highest run rate to accomplish this.   

So from the offshore perspective, that would mean keeping about seven folks including you.   We would keep Seema here until she had to go back to India and make some other adjustments. 


This is all preliminary based on some rough numbers Brad gave me.  It could change at any time.

As part of this SIT testing on CCRMTEST, we will be loading fairly large amounts of data and consuming a lot of CPU and clock time.   During these tests, there will be the risk of data corruption - that is what SIT testing is supposed to find and resolve.   We cannot afford; however, to start process from the beginning if we have an error.   In short, we need database backups scheduled in as an integral part of our SIT testing so that we do not loose weeks of work.  

Tentatively, we should plan on once per day at a certain time.  We'll work the job execution schedule to not interfere with this time.  For planning, how long would you expect a backup to take for 300 - 400 Gbyte?    We are just adding and not updating data in general for this phase, so incremental should work very well.

For your question below. 

The first query does not look at source system in UDD.  Therefore, you will count all rows for all LOBS in the dimension.

The second query does join by source system.   But if you don't have all source systems there, you will only count for the LOBs that are currently loaded into MSTG.


For instance, if only ILS is loaded into MSTG, you will only join with ILS rows from UDD (second query).   But the first query will return for all LOBS - not just ILS.   The UDD is persistent and pre-loaded.   The rows will be there from the beginning.

Henry,

I will discuss these with the team today and will make the necessary modifications to the scripts. We will add the queries to the UDD-MRT scripts as well.  One clarification -

3) This query assumes that ALL data is loaded for all LOBS.   Note that there is no source system specified.   We probably should have count mismatch, even here, because there are some rows that should never roll to !!unknown so this count will be low.  

We are taking the SRC_STM_CD in the select clause and that is the reason there is just one query for all the LOBs. Is this ok?

Subject:        RE: Do yo have a test script

Praveen,

Is this and example of what you are referring to? 

The first count will show you the number of rows that were inserted into the UDA for a dimension. 

The second count  (may) show you the count of distinct rows where there is a match between MSTG fact table and UDA table.

So here are my thoughts - you can verify with your team.

1) All rows will not be inserted this run, so you cannot assume that insert batch id will be set equal to the data coming in.  

2) This is a count of rows in the dimension table, not a count of rows from the fact table.   We could still have orphans in the fact table below and as long as you had a join with all dimension rows, these counts would match.   Even if some facts were indeed orphans.

3) This query assumes that ALL data is loaded for all LOBS.   Note that there is no source system specified.   We probably should have count mismatch, even here, because there are some rows that should never roll to !!unknown so this count will be low.  


4) This query assumes that the orphan process has already run.  





5) All LOBS do not use the same Aks.   i.e. one lob may only use AK1 and another may use all 4.    In the cases where all are not used, you cannot join on the missing ones because they will be null.   You always need to join on the xxxx_CD column which is a concatenation of the valid keys for that LOB. 



Here is one way to verify that no facts or orphans. 

-- Select count(*) from X_MSTG.D_CRED_FCLT B

-- select count(*) from X_MSTG.D_CRED_FCLT B, X_UDA.UDD_LOB_HIER_CD a
Where a.lob_hier_cd = b.lob_hier_cd

** the counts above should be the same  


You also need to verify the final mart tables.   As a matter of fact, if the mart tables are correct, you know that the UDD and MSTG is correct

-- Select count(*) from ccrm_mrt..D_CRED_FCLT B

-- select count(*) from ccrm_mrt.D_CRED_FCLT B, ccrm_mrt.UDD_LOB_HIER_CD a
Where a.lob_hier_id = b.lob_hier_-d


We don't need to make a lot of noise about this with approvals.   Let's just enhance our scripts and we'll check in new version at the end. 


Let me know if one of your folks does not agree with my analysis above.  






To verify the count of STG and UDD should be same.      1        SELECT COUNT(1) FROM X_UDA.UDD_LOB_HIER_CD

WHERE LEFT(B.INS_BATCH_ID,8)='20070131'
        BOTH THE COUNT SHOULD BE SAME  
        2       SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT B.L0B_HIER_CD,B.SRC_STM_CD,B.L0B_AK1,B.L0B_AK2,B.L0B_AK3,B.L0B_AK4) FROM X_UDA.UDD_LOB_HIER_CD A,X_MSTG.D_CRED_FCLT B

WHERE A.SRC_STM_CD=B.SRC_STM_CD AND
A.L0B_HIER_CD=B.L0B_HIER_CD AND
A.L0B_AK1=B.A.L0B_AK1 AND
A.L0B_AK2=B.A.L0B_AK2 AND
A.L0B_AK3=B.A.L0B_AK3 AND
A.L0B_AK4=B.A.L0B_AK4 AND

I have attached the STG to UDD test script. The first 2 scenarios under each dimension will make sure that there are no orphans.

There are some join condition for fact which are missing in mapping doc and even while profiling there is mismatch.



Join condition for Note type is mentioned as

JOIN X_MRT_CCRM.D_note_TYPE note ON
note.note_TP_DSC = UPPER(TYPE_OF_LOAN) AND note.SRC_STM_CD = 'CLS'

Type_of_Loan is Business and note_tp_desc is like DEMAND LOAN, UNDEFINED, !!UNKNOWN

Above join seems to be incorrect



In below join T2 BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SCR_RECENT data is coming as BECO, ALARM etc, as we are comparing it with RSK_SCORE which is score number.

It seems to be incorrect.

JOIN X_MRT_CCRM.D_RISK_SCORE bhv ON
bhv.RSK_SCORE = coalesce(right(('000'||trim(char(integer(T2.BEHAV_RISK_GRADE_SCR_RECENT)))),3),'!!UNK') AND bhv.RSK_SCORE_ISSR_NM = 'ALARM'


In This join Reason for loss is coming as Null in source

JOIN X_MRT_CCRM.D_STATUS_REASON lossstatrsn ON
lossstatrsn.STATUS_RSN_CD = upper(T2.REASON_FOR_LOSS) AND lossstatrsn.STATUS_RSN_IND = 'LOSS'


When we join with obligor Dim, rowcount is not matching for FACT there is huge diff near abt 6lac records.


For couple of hours I was getting error,  while saving of copying file, snapshot in the attached doc but later it got resolved. <<Error while saving or copying.doc>>  so due to that got struct.

We know from History if we are pulling from BMSC or BMSR and I believe they are separate loads.

So when joining for BMSC there really isn't a \"join\", but can be done like this

inner join x_hst_mrt_ccrm.d_gl_account a
 on  a.src_stm_cd = 'MVS'
 AND a.gl_acct_cd = '96'

BMSR would be:

inner join x_hst_mrt_ccrm.d_gl_account a
 on  a.src_stm_cd = 'MVS'
 AND a.gl_acct_cd = '95'


If they aren't separate loads then
ON a.SRC_STM_CD ='MVS'
AND CASE a.LOB_INDICATOR when 'BMSC'    THEN ''96' ELSE '95 END = GL_ACCT_CD

We don't want to populate with LOB_INDICATOR - that can't come from the MONTHLY.  For monthly we use the CORPORATION number, and we can determine the CORPORATION number based on BMSC or BMSR.  We don't want HIST~ when we can put in the records to match the monthly..

Hi Beth

The mapping document is locked.
Also in History we are not getting the corporation number anywhere in combined dataset.
Thats why for History LOB is populated using the LOB_INDICATOR which is unique and GL has 'HIST'~GL_ACCOUNT_NO.

GL_ACCT_CD
HIST~15470
HIST~15471

Since we have separate combined dataset for BMSC and BMSR , we have to do a union all for these two datsets (or process them one by one) as mentioned in history mapping doc.

X_HST.BMSR_FULL_DS
X_HST.BMSC_FULL_DS

We discussed using the CORP NUMBER for process going forward and its reflected in Monthly mapdoc.

Let me know if my understanding is wrong, we can get into a call.

Thanks & Regards

Had a 50/50 shot and got it backwards of course!! :)

Can you get the History mapping updated to reflect using of CORP NUMBER to get the LOB_HIER and I will take care of the data.  And make sure kishor and team know about the update as well..

This is a summary of things we went over in meeting today.  Let me know if additions or corrections.  

We have a few prerequisite tasks that need to be performed on the CCRMTEST / BDWTEST boxes.  All need to be complete by Feb 16th.  

1) Final userid setup with profiles, etc.
  ** Doug Hodges coordinates

2) Allocate Space
    ** kishor to provide space requirements - Done
    ** Doug Hodges to work space with UNIX support after requirements are known - Done

3) Establish 3 permission groups on two databases for userids that currently exist on CCRMDEV - Done 
    a) ETLLOAD - all authority CCRMTEST and BDWTEST
    b) TESTERS - Read only in CCRMTEST, Read only in BDWTEST except write in ETL and WRK schemas
    b+) TESTERS - Also need RWX authority on /mart_dev/ccrm directory and below - both DEV and TEST
          *** they need this authority in DEV also
    c) DEVELOPERS - Read only in CCRMTEST, Read only in BDWTEST
    c+) DEVELOPERS - Also need RWX athority on /mart_dev/ccrm directory and below  on DEV.  Need R authority on /mart_dev/ccrm dirctory and below on TEST

    ** Doug to coordinate this with UNIX and Farah
    ** Henry to supply userid list and groups. 
    D) USERS - Need select, update, insert on all tables in UDA schema.   Need select on all tables in MRT_CCRM schema.  


4) Configure SAS server for access to all environments
   ** Melanie will coordinate

Approximate sequence of events of SIT / UAT in TEST   -- Begins now and runs three weeks

1) Load TEST UDD from unload of DEV UDD - Insert into scripts
2) Load mart dimensions from UDD with scripts 
2) Run SAS programs to create delimited datasets back to SAS server
3) Transfer delimited datasets to CCRMTEST
5) Run the History Loads
6) Execute SIT/UAT
7) Approval - test is now ready for first Informatica monthly load
8) At this point, the historical data is completely loaded and approved.
9) Backup and redirected restore of CCRMTEST data to CCRMPROD
    ** Doug to coordinate this with DBA group
10) PROD will be loaded with the migrated data and ready for first Informatica monthly load

Hi Seema,



I have configured your ID on SIT box and changed the password. Your new passowrd is feb2009.
I haven't set up .profile for your ID. You can try logging with this ID on box and try to connect to database also. Pls let me know if you face any issue.

PFA the Load Scripts from SAS data sets to FULL_DS tables and all the load scripts( OBLGR, COLL, ARR_MAX, DIM and FACT). All the attached scripts have been modified according to SIT Environment( Schema, file locations etc.)

I have also attached the Execution Plan SS having detalis for all 11 Lobs.

The /bdw_dev/ebdw/data/src/wrk/cred_fclt/final 
loaction contains all the scripts according to DEV parameters ( as we have to load full data in DEV in MRT_CCRM schema for MSTR reporting).

Here we have loaded for
EQFIN--> all 5 tables
PRIME--> dim is loaded ( we need to populate max again as it is load replace, no need to run OBLGR, COLL and DIM. FACT is giving some issue, will look at it tommorow).

SHEFF --> all 5 tables( fact is having 23 indexes and dim around 19 , so taking a lot of time :(  
You can start with ILS .

Running sequence :-
1. ARR_MAX( replace mode)
2.COLL ( insert)
3.OBL  ( insert)
4.DIM   ( insert)
5.FACT  ( insert)



All scripts are ready.
<<SIT Execution Plan.xls>> <<final.zip>> <<load_scripts.zip>>
We need to be very careful of below points :-

1. ARR Max is always in replace mode.( in fact we have join on arrangement_ID  only , not on Application_Code, so this is critical).

2. OBLGR, COLL, FACT and DIM  are in insert mode.
3. We are running these in correct sequence ( as it might happen that we run OBL for a a particular LOB twice )


Pls review the Plan and SIT Execution Plan.
You can call me if there are nay issues.

Currently we have 2 indexes. Can we drop indexes other than unique index till we load data? If required, we can build indexes after load.



I am referring only to DEV box.

If we get partitioning, we will have to depend on DBA, but we will still not lose data for other LOBs.

So I would still prefer partitioning option ahead of other options.

Subject: MDC decision



All, 

This has been a topic of discussion since early this year.  We need a decision now for Q171D.  First I'll lay out the scenario.

We have a target table being loaded.  It gets loaded from 12 independent sources by 12 independent job streams.  They are identified by a \"source system\" column.   We have not built any dependencies into these loads. 

So we can run any number of sources into this target table.   If a rerun is needed is the scenario where our opportunity arises.   The rerun (for that source system) will need to delete rows for that source system before it restarts.   DELETE where source system = .   Obviously, a logging situation arises here.   The deletion size could be tens of Gbyte for our largest systems.  So it seems we have three options:

1) We implement the restart capability by including deletes in all sources.   Note that in general, the delete will never actually execute.  We will need log space size to support this delete.   With this option, a restart of one source can be independent and other loaded sources will not be impacted.  DBA implemented MDC tables might speed this and reduce logging requirements. 

2) We use truncate which will not use log space and will be fast.   However, truncate will delete all sources.   Everything will need to be restarted, not just the system in error.  Do note that this should be an exceptional occurrence that will not happen. 

3) DBA's implement a partitioning strategy whereas a partition can be detached and attached if there is an error.   This will be a completely manual operation requiring DBA support if an error were to occur. 

The only workable solution we have at the moment is to do the truncate.  That is the solution implemented in the eBDW.

The above scenario is for staging tables which only have one transient month.   For the final mart target table, all of history is contained and a truncate will not be acceptable.  There, we will depend on manual intervention if a restart is necessary.   Either via a DBA controlled recovery from backup or by DBA implemented partitioning strategy.  

These are the solutions we will work toward now unless alternative is proposed by COB Feb 17th which can be implemented this week.  I believe they are fairly consistent with strategies you currently have in place for existing systems.

See message below.   History cannot be loaded because our developer's have no access to the 50 Gig space that was established.   I'm summarizing all of the issues separately.

Yes. I agree.

Right now biggest hurdle in starting SIT is getting access on UNIX. We can not even load FULL_DS as we do not have access to /ccrminstall directory and none of the other directories have space enough to hold history file for 1 LOB.

One clarification on the model/ddl items.  As you said, Beth sent  one table change to the work table structures on 2/9, but had additional changes before I submitted the DPSR resulting in nearly all work tables changing. (See her comments below).  The actual request was submitted on 2/11.

Per Beth:

That is fine with me.  Don't worry about this fix right now.  Base on discussions about changes that will happen with the HUB, I am getting ready to send you changes to all the WRK tables.  The only change, besides the one listed below, will be the NULLability of the numeric columns.  Right now the WRK tables mimic the NULL/NOT NULL attribute of each column, because that looks to change for the HUB in the near future.  I am going to go ahead and allow for those columns to be NULLable in our WRK tables.  I will update that ddl here shortly and shoot you an email when it is out on the server.

Thanks,

After talking to Henry, we may need to let the hardcoded values go, but they do have to be correct, so they would have to be validated against the newly loaded dim tables in MRT_CCRM.  Testing may be able to handle flushing that out.

I started with the d_cred_fclt ones next will be collateral.
you can have a look at AR_MAX , OBLGR and then fact - which should be mostly straight moves.

Also i had one question
Is hardcoding ids like this is ok, since we have SRC_STM_CD wise !!NA and !!UNK records in all dimensions.
This is in all the scripts so I thought its OK and might have been discussed in last 2 weeks....

The review comment in the scripts says
--Pls verify the hardcoded ID fields from dimensions before loading and also check for load insert option---

-14 AS BOR_CD_ID, -- needs to be hardcoded

-14 AS CTGRY_ID, -- needs to be hardcoded

Hi Seema,

CLS fact load is in progress.

1. Obligor -
There are few records which has not been loaded due to records available in COM/SBB but for a particular month not available in the Train2 dataset.

Due to this obligor is not getting loaded for this records and same is affecting the FACT load for those many records. (227 records missing in FACT and 22 obligors)

Eg.
Counterpary_id - '470002135700000' has max_date as '6/30/2006' in SBB_FULL_DS
For related arrangement ids in CLS train2 max date is '5/31/2006' ('470002135700007000','470002135700005000')
Due to this, same counterparty is not getting loaded.
>> Pls send me the 22 obligor ids.

2. LTV_RATIO column of fact table (Decimal 8,5) is mapped with LTV_PERCENTAGE (double). But the source column data like shown below.

This data seems to be incorrect. Let us know what needs to be done.
LTV_PERCENTAGE
0.0000000001882353
0.0000000003007356
0.0000000010666667

Note: When cast the above data to decimal 8,5 its giving data overflow error. I have mapped currently to null. Once I get the update, I will reload that again.

>> Will reply in some time. Need confirmation from Beth. If we need to convert that as percentage.

3. TOT_EXPCTD_PYMT_AMT column is mappped with T2.NBR_SCHDULED_PAYMENTS. This source column contains number of scheduled payments and not amount.

Correct our understading.

The correct mapping as per sas inventory is
T2      X_HST.CLS_TRAIN2_FULL_DS        NBR_SCHDULED_PAYMENTS                                                                                                   Straight Move           F_CRED_FCLT_MTH REMAIN_PYMT_CNT

That sounds like a good plan to me.  Yes, for now we will have to just round/truncate to the 5 digits.  They were suppose to update the BDW to allow for larger data types, but that hasn't happened. 

Do we store the PROPERTY_DOLLARS in any field in the Mart now?  I would think usually for the LTV_PERCENTAGE they would be looking to band it and not necessarily do a lot of additional calculations with it.  But if we had the base fields that are used in the calc then we would be covered either way.

MLS stores the value as percentage and same is done in Monthly
LTV_RATIO =(FIRST_PRIN_BAL / PROPERTY_DOLLARS) * 100 ;
LTV_RATIO
50.57
54.09
51.44
44.71
44.71
42.21
49.85

For CLS then , we will just multiple the fomula by 100 to get percentage in Monthly and same for History so that its consistent.

LTV_PERCENTAGE = (CURRENT_FACILITY_AMOUNT/CURR_COLLATERAL_VALUE) * 100 ;  

Even after doing that , the value will be truncated to 5 places after decimal and we need not store all the digits after decimal?

LTV_PERCENTGE is coming from SFW also but its hardcoded to 100 in the code that sounds like percentage.

Thanks & Regards

It doesn't matter to me if we store it like this or multiply it by 100 as long as the LTV_PERCENTAGE looks the same across all LOBs and between History and Monthly.  I believe MLA we store just the result of the calculation as it comes.  What are we planning to do for Monthly.? LTV_RATIO is stored as and 8,5 because that is how it would be stored in the USM/BDW.

The LTV percentage in CLS train 2 is
Select LTV_PERCENTAGE from X_HST.cls_TRAIN2_FULL_DS

 LTV_PERCENTAGE = CURRENT_FACILITY_AMOUNT/CURR_COLLATERAL_VALUE; 

But in History data looks like its not stored as Percentage (its just the result of division) and we have defined the LTV_RATIO in MRT as DECIMAL(8,5)

Surrogate keys are just that.   Keys that could change at any time and have no meaning.  They absolutely should not be hardcoded anywhere at all in a single Informatica mapping.  

I'm not sure of why you guys choose to hardcode keys in history loads, it could  be for performance or simplicity sake.   It is way too late to pull joins back in now, but you must ensure that the hardcoded keys actually match the tables as they are now in MART_CCRM on CCRMDEV.  Beth, please confirm, that what is there now in these dimensions will get moved with key consistency to TEST.

Henry,

We know that Surrogate keys are supposed to change and all our initial scripts were with actual joins and not hardcoding.
Reason why we chose to hardcode was:
1. DB2 was giving an error of 'SQL is suboptimal' and when we reduced number of joins, SQL ran fine. This was primary reason. We spent few days working around this, but could not get SQL with joins working.
2. Already our SQLs are complex and take long time. In most cases adding 6-7 more joins was making it take too long.

On the other side, testing team has test scripts for foreign keys and any such descripancy will come out during testing.
Also, when we are loading in CCRMDEV again, we are verifying the keys again.

Sounds like communication is the key here.   I've talked with Seema and Beth and neither were aware of the issues or the direction taken here.  The code we had written as working examples was not used. 

I just communicated today with Praveen the kinds of tests that would need to be done to verify that we don't have problems with this shortcut.   He was not aware of this issue.  I've looked at the current scripts - nothing was there yet to verify this. 

What I suggested to Seema is that you compare the original working dimension tables that you initially used for hardcoding and compare them against the ones now in the real schema to see exactly what is different.   That should point you to places exactly to look.    

To be clear, I am not suggesting that we add these joins back in at this juncture.   We just need to make sure that the hardcoding is in sync with the tables.   Both with due diligence on developer part and additional testing from Test team.

Henry,

One clarification on the model/ddl items.  As you said, Beth sent  one table change to the work table structures on 2/9, but had additional changes before I submitted the DPSR resulting in nearly all work tables changing. (See her comments below).  The actual request was submitted on 2/11.

Per Beth:

That is fine with me.  Don't worry about this fix right now.  Base on discussions about changes that will happen with the HUB, I am getting ready to send you changes to all the WRK tables.  The only change, besides the one listed below, will be the NULLability of the numeric columns.  Right now the WRK tables mimic the NULL/NOT NULL attribute of each column, because that looks to change for the HUB in the near future.  I am going to go ahead and allow for those columns to be NULLable in our WRK tables.  I will update that ddl here shortly and shoot you an email when it is out on the server.

Thanks,
Jim

Do you know when the table move happen?



Yesterday I had completed OBLGR, COLL, D_CRED_FCLT & F_CRED_FCLT for 5 LOBs. But when I checked today data for these LOBs is not present in MRT_CCRM.D_CRED_FCLT & MRT_CCRM.F_CRED_FCLT tables.



I finished loading data for 5 LOBs at around 1:30 PM EST yesterday and tables were moved to new tablespace at 2:30 PM EST.



Can you please check?



Thanks,

You can try with BMSR ( around 14 GB) . We are able to FTP load scripts here ( very small in size around few Kbs), there might be issue with the size of file being FTPed.

Hi Henry,


We are not able to FTP files from SAS Server to our SIT box. The FTP starts normally and goes well till 98% , after that it aborts giving the attached  << File: FTP Issue.doc >> Error Message. We have tried this with a70368 as well as ETLLOAD Id. We are getting issue with both Ids.

So we will be not be able to load FULL_DS tables.

We are able to create files and directories in /crminstall/  .



Thanks,
kishor

Do you know when the table move happen?



Yesterday I had completed OBLGR, COLL, D_CRED_FCLT & F_CRED_FCLT for 5 LOBs. But when I checked today data for these LOBs is not present in MRT_CCRM.D_CRED_FCLT & MRT_CCRM.F_CRED_FCLT tables.



I finished loading data for 5 LOBs at around 1:30 PM EST yesterday and tables were moved to new tablespace at 2:30 PM EST.



Can you please check?

Henry,



We are still facing 2 issues:



1. We got access to /ccrminstall directory. However, when we tried FTP for SAS files, the FTP fails after 98% completion. We tried this with multiple IDs. Because of this, we are not able to get started on loading FULL_DS.
2. In CCRMDEV, we had started loading of Credit facility in a single table and we had completed loading of 5 LOBs. But looks like CRED_FCLT tables were recreated and we do not have data in the tables.  


Thanks,

Beth,



Do you know when the table move happen?



Yesterday I had completed OBLGR, COLL, D_CRED_FCLT & F_CRED_FCLT for 5 LOBs. But when I checked today data for these LOBs is not present in MRT_CCRM.D_CRED_FCLT & MRT_CCRM.F_CRED_FCLT tables.



I finished loading data for 5 LOBs at around 1:30 PM EST yesterday and tables were moved to new tablespace at 2:30 PM EST.



Can you please check?



Thanks,

We are trying to FTP from SAS Server <file://\\wil-sasprd02\BaseCreditRisk\CCRM>\\wil-sasprd02\BaseCreditRisk\CCRM BI\History\   to /crminstall/test1  in SIT BOX. We have 10 tab delimted files there.

You can try with BMSR ( around 14 GB) . We are able to FTP load scripts here ( very small in size around few Kbs), there might be issue with the size of file being FTPed.

Hi Henry,


We are not able to FTP files from SAS Server to our SIT box. The FTP starts normally and goes well till 98% , after that it aborts giving the attached  << File: FTP Issue.doc >> Error Message. We have tried this with a70368 as well as ETLLOAD Id. We are getting issue with both Ids.

So we will be not be able to load FULL_DS tables.

We are able to create files and directories in /crminstall/  .



Thanks,

Ramesh,



We are almost at the end of project. Development activities will be over in next 2 weeks and we will be in SIT / UAT for 1 more month.

We will not have time to implement any new processes that we add.



However, your valuable help in setting up processes and audit will be very helpful in phase 2 of the project which is likely to start in April.



Considering this, do you think we should start implementing QL support from phase 2 of the project?

A couple of notes that I am seeing in the History scripts.

The New_indicator field is being set to 'Y'/'N', this isn't a flag field.  The values in this field should be 'NEW' /'N' or 'NOT QUITE NEW' /'NQ' (Seema, can you verify what we are doing for monthly).

Additionally the Active change status, need to make sure the record cannot have Active Status = 'I' with the ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS  = 'NtoY' or 'YtoY'
    for example in SFW we have records that Have a current status of 'I'  and a CHANGE STATUS = 'N', this is getting translated to ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS = 'YtoY'

select A.*
from (
Select T1.DATA_DATE, T1.ARRANGEMENT_ID
, T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS
, T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS

       ELSE 'N'
  END                           AS ACT_INACT_FLG
, CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA','N') THEN 'YtoY'
       WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI ') THEN 'YtoN'
       WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IS NULL THEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS

Henry,

Since we are hardcoding the !!NA & !!UNK foreign keys, testing team has written scripts for validating these keys. In these validation scripts, we do ont have any hardcoding, but actual joins. Thus, any wrong hardcoding will be pointed out in testing.
In fact, during our testing in DEV, testing team pointed few such descripancies which we corrected. This is recorded in test log as well.
I will send all test scripts which show testing for !!NA & !!UNK keys. But following is a sample:

kishor,

Sounds like communication is the key here.   I've talked with Seema and Beth and neither were aware of the issues or the direction taken here.  The code we had written as working examples was not used. 

I just communicated today with Praveen the kinds of tests that would need to be done to verify that we don't have problems with this shortcut.   He was not aware of this issue.  I've looked at the current scripts - nothing was there yet to verify this. 

What I suggested to Seema is that you compare the original working dimension tables that you initially used for hardcoding and compare them against the ones now in the real schema to see exactly what is different.   That should point you to places exactly to look.    

To be clear, I am not suggesting that we add these joins back in at this juncture.   We just need to make sure that the hardcoding is in sync with the tables.   Both with due diligence on developer part and additional testing from Test team.

Henry,

We know that Surrogate keys are supposed to change and all our initial scripts were with actual joins and not hardcoding.
Reason why we chose to hardcode was:
1. DB2 was giving an error of 'SQL is suboptimal' and when we reduced number of joins, SQL ran fine. This was primary reason. We spent few days working around this, but could not get SQL with joins working.
2. Already our SQLs are complex and take long time. In most cases adding 6-7 more joins was making it take too long.

On the other side, testing team has test scripts for foreign keys and any such descripancy will come out during testing.
Also, when we are loading in CCRMDEV again, we are verifying the keys again.

Thanks,

kishor

Surrogate keys are just that.   Keys that could change at any time and have no meaning.  They absolutely should not be hardcoded anywhere at all in a single Informatica mapping.  

I'm not sure of why you guys choose to hardcode keys in history loads, it could  be for performance or simplicity sake.   It is way too late to pull joins back in now, but you must ensure that the hardcoded keys actually match the tables as they are now in MART_CCRM on CCRMDEV.  Beth, please confirm, that what is there now in these dimensions will get moved with key consistency to TEST.  

We will perhaps have to revive several of these 'one-time' scripts for phase 2 to add train-2 columns and rerun.   We will need to look at this again then.

They could have changed.  There had been a couple of !!UNK or !!NA fields that got added to the tables late.  Surrogate keys are not transferred over.  In theory, for all the table with SRC_STM_CD as part of NK, the SK should be the same number in all the tables. 

For example, for CLS -3 should be !!UNK in all the tables and -4 should be the !!NA.  But SK should have never been hard coded in the scripts.  I don't believe the scripts that Henry and I wrote there is any hard coding for SKs.

Beth,



Do you know when the table move happen?



Yesterday I had completed OBLGR, COLL, D_CRED_FCLT & F_CRED_FCLT for 5 LOBs. But when I checked today data for these LOBs is not present in MRT_CCRM.D_CRED_FCLT & MRT_CCRM.F_CRED_FCLT tables.



I finished loading data for 5 LOBs at around 1:30 PM EST yesterday and tables were moved to new tablespace at 2:30 PM EST.



Can you please check?



Thanks,

Since we are hardcoding the !!NA & !!UNK foreign keys, testing team has written scripts for validating these keys. In these validation scripts, we do ont have any hardcoding, but actual joins. Thus, any wrong hardcoding will be pointed out in testing.
In fact, during our testing in DEV, testing team pointed few such descripancies which we corrected. This is recorded in test log as well.
I will send all test scripts which show testing for !!NA & !!UNK keys. But following is a sample:

kishor,

Sounds like communication is the key here.   I've talked with Seema and Beth and neither were aware of the issues or the direction taken here.  The code we had written as working examples was not used. 

I just communicated today with Praveen the kinds of tests that would need to be done to verify that we don't have problems with this shortcut.   He was not aware of this issue.  I've looked at the current scripts - nothing was there yet to verify this. 

What I suggested to Seema is that you compare the original working dimension tables that you initially used for hardcoding and compare them against the ones now in the real schema to see exactly what is different.   That should point you to places exactly to look.    

To be clear, I am not suggesting that we add these joins back in at this juncture.   We just need to make sure that the hardcoding is in sync with the tables.   Both with due diligence on developer part and additional testing from Test team.

Henry,

We know that Surrogate keys are supposed to change and all our initial scripts were with actual joins and not hardcoding.
Reason why we chose to hardcode was:
1. DB2 was giving an error of 'SQL is suboptimal' and when we reduced number of joins, SQL ran fine. This was primary reason. We spent few days working around this, but could not get SQL with joins working.
2. Already our SQLs are complex and take long time. In most cases adding 6-7 more joins was making it take too long.

On the other side, testing team has test scripts for foreign keys and any such descripancy will come out during testing.
Also, when we are loading in CCRMDEV again, we are verifying the keys again.

Thanks,

kishor

Surrogate keys are just that.   Keys that could change at any time and have no meaning.  They absolutely should not be hardcoded anywhere at all in a single Informatica mapping.  

I'm not sure of why you guys choose to hardcode keys in history loads, it could  be for performance or simplicity sake.   It is way too late to pull joins back in now, but you must ensure that the hardcoded keys actually match the tables as they are now in MART_CCRM on CCRMDEV.  Beth, please confirm, that what is there now in these dimensions will get moved with key consistency to TEST.  

We will perhaps have to revive several of these 'one-time' scripts for phase 2 to add train-2 columns and rerun.   We will need to look at this again then.

They could have changed.  There had been a couple of !!UNK or !!NA fields that got added to the tables late.  Surrogate keys are not transferred over.  In theory, for all the table with SRC_STM_CD as part of NK, the SK should be the same number in all the tables. 

For example, for CLS -3 should be !!UNK in all the tables and -4 should be the !!NA.  But SK should have never been hard coded in the scripts.  I don't believe the scripts that Henry and I wrote there is any hard coding for SKs.

Beth,



Do you know when the table move happen?



Yesterday I had completed OBLGR, COLL, D_CRED_FCLT & F_CRED_FCLT for 5 LOBs. But when I checked today data for these LOBs is not present in MRT_CCRM.D_CRED_FCLT & MRT_CCRM.F_CRED_FCLT tables.



I finished loading data for 5 LOBs at around 1:30 PM EST yesterday and tables were moved to new tablespace at 2:30 PM EST.



Can you please check?



Thanks,

Henry,

Since we are hardcoding the !!NA & !!UNK foreign keys, testing team has written scripts for validating these keys. In these validation scripts, we do ont have any hardcoding, but actual joins. Thus, any wrong hardcoding will be pointed out in testing.
In fact, during our testing in DEV, testing team pointed few such descripancies which we corrected. This is recorded in test log as well.
I will send all test scripts which show testing for !!NA & !!UNK keys. But following is a sample:


Below are some sample defects raised by testing team which are present in defect log.

kishor,

Sounds like communication is the key here.   I've talked with Seema and Beth and neither were aware of the issues or the direction taken here.  The code we had written as working examples was not used. 

I just communicated today with Praveen the kinds of tests that would need to be done to verify that we don't have problems with this shortcut.   He was not aware of this issue.  I've looked at the current scripts - nothing was there yet to verify this. 

What I suggested to Seema is that you compare the original working dimension tables that you initially used for hardcoding and compare them against the ones now in the real schema to see exactly what is different.   That should point you to places exactly to look.    

To be clear, I am not suggesting that we add these joins back in at this juncture.   We just need to make sure that the hardcoding is in sync with the tables.   Both with due diligence on developer part and additional testing from Test team.

Henry,

We know that Surrogate keys are supposed to change and all our initial scripts were with actual joins and not hardcoding.
Reason why we chose to hardcode was:
1. DB2 was giving an error of 'SQL is suboptimal' and when we reduced number of joins, SQL ran fine. This was primary reason. We spent few days working around this, but could not get SQL with joins working.
2. Already our SQLs are complex and take long time. In most cases adding 6-7 more joins was making it take too long.

On the other side, testing team has test scripts for foreign keys and any such descripancy will come out during testing.
Also, when we are loading in CCRMDEV again, we are verifying the keys again.

Thanks,

kishor

Surrogate keys are just that.   Keys that could change at any time and have no meaning.  They absolutely should not be hardcoded anywhere at all in a single Informatica mapping.  

I'm not sure of why you guys choose to hardcode keys in history loads, it could  be for performance or simplicity sake.   It is way too late to pull joins back in now, but you must ensure that the hardcoded keys actually match the tables as they are now in MART_CCRM on CCRMDEV.  Beth, please confirm, that what is there now in these dimensions will get moved with key consistency to TEST.  

We will perhaps have to revive several of these 'one-time' scripts for phase 2 to add train-2 columns and rerun.   We will need to look at this again then.

They could have changed.  There had been a couple of !!UNK or !!NA fields that got added to the tables late.  Surrogate keys are not transferred over.  In theory, for all the table with SRC_STM_CD as part of NK, the SK should be the same number in all the tables. 

For example, for CLS -3 should be !!UNK in all the tables and -4 should be the !!NA.  But SK should have never been hard coded in the scripts.  I don't believe the scripts that Henry and I wrote there is any hard coding for SKs.

In Monthly the NEW_IND is populates in STG-->MRT as

IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')<= 2 THEN 'NEW'
IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')> 2 'NOT QUITE NEW'

Its not there in WRK --> STG. However the field is there in MSTG_F_CRED_FCLT. So we need to add the same logic in WRK_STG layer also.
Was NEW_IND added in MSTG fact recently?

For History  - its mapped as follows: 

IF T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('N','NQ') THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N'

Since history has all ACCOUNT_STATUS like A,I,T1,TO, N , NQ coming as source , so we decided to decode it to Y/N for history , else we need to derive it based on origination date and data date.
Let me know , we have to do the derivation in History also? And what do we decode the other ACCOUNT_STATUSES to (A,I, etc...)?


For ACCT_INACT_CHG_IND the logic is

CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA','N') THEN 'YtoY' WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI','NQtoI') THEN 'YtoN' ELSE 'NtoY' END

Since CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS  = 'N' i.e NEW , so its decoded to 'YtoY'.
If the change account status is 'N' , Current account status = I (Inactive) seems to be wrong.

I am checking this in other LOB's.

A couple of notes that I am seeing in the History scripts.

The New_indicator field is being set to 'Y'/'N', this isn't a flag field.  The values in this field should be 'NEW' /'N' or 'NOT QUITE NEW' /'NQ' (Seema, can you verify what we are doing for monthly).

Additionally the Active change status, need to make sure the record cannot have Active Status = 'I' with the ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS  = 'NtoY' or 'YtoY'
    for example in SFW we have records that Have a current status of 'I'  and a CHANGE STATUS = 'N', this is getting translated to ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS = 'YtoY'

select A.*

       WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IS NULL THEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS

Since we are hardcoding the !!NA & !!UNK foreign keys, testing team has written scripts for validating these keys. In these validation scripts, we do ont have any hardcoding, but actual joins. Thus, any wrong hardcoding will be pointed out in testing.
In fact, during our testing in DEV, testing team pointed few such descripancies which we corrected. This is recorded in test log as well.

kishor,

Sounds like communication is the key here.   I've talked with Seema and Beth and neither were aware of the issues or the direction taken here.  The code we had written as working examples was not used. 

I just communicated today with Praveen the kinds of tests that would need to be done to verify that we don't have problems with this shortcut.   He was not aware of this issue.  I've looked at the current scripts - nothing was there yet to verify this. 

What I suggested to Seema is that you compare the original working dimension tables that you initially used for hardcoding and compare them against the ones now in the real schema to see exactly what is different.   That should point you to places exactly to look.    

To be clear, I am not suggesting that we add these joins back in at this juncture.   We just need to make sure that the hardcoding is in sync with the tables.   Both with due diligence on developer part and additional testing from Test team.

Henry,

We know that Surrogate keys are supposed to change and all our initial scripts were with actual joins and not hardcoding.
Reason why we chose to hardcode was:
1. DB2 was giving an error of 'SQL is suboptimal' and when we reduced number of joins, SQL ran fine. This was primary reason. We spent few days working around this, but could not get SQL with joins working.
2. Already our SQLs are complex and take long time. In most cases adding 6-7 more joins was making it take too long.

On the other side, testing team has test scripts for foreign keys and any such descripancy will come out during testing.
Also, when we are loading in CCRMDEV again, we are verifying the keys again.

Thanks,

Surrogate keys are just that.   Keys that could change at any time and have no meaning.  They absolutely should not be hardcoded anywhere at all in a single Informatica mapping.  

I'm not sure of why you guys choose to hardcode keys in history loads, it could  be for performance or simplicity sake.   It is way too late to pull joins back in now, but you must ensure that the hardcoded keys actually match the tables as they are now in MART_CCRM on CCRMDEV.  Beth, please confirm, that what is there now in these dimensions will get moved with key consistency to TEST.  

We will perhaps have to revive several of these 'one-time' scripts for phase 2 to add train-2 columns and rerun.   We will need to look at this again then.

They could have changed.  There had been a couple of !!UNK or !!NA fields that got added to the tables late.  Surrogate keys are not transferred over.  In theory, for all the table with SRC_STM_CD as part of NK, the SK should be the same number in all the tables. 

For example, for CLS -3 should be !!UNK in all the tables and -4 should be the !!NA.  But SK should have never been hard coded in the scripts.  I don't believe the scripts that Henry and I wrote there is any hard coding for SKs.

For monthly, we need to only do the logic in one place.  It either happens in WRK to STG or STG to MRT. 

As discussed on the phone, they've already determined N and NQ in the ACCOUNT_STATUS.  We just translate those to 'NEW' and 'NOT QUITE NEW'  else NULL (or other default).  We need HISTORY to match as closely with the monthly process as possible other wise the data and reporting won't work well if we have different values loaded for HISTORY vs what we do for the monthly.

Hi Beth

In Monthly the NEW_IND is populates in STG-->MRT as

IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')<= 2 THEN 'NEW'
IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')> 2 'NOT QUITE NEW'

Its not there in WRK --> STG. However the field is there in MSTG_F_CRED_FCLT. So we need to add the same logic in WRK_STG layer also.
Was NEW_IND added in MSTG fact recently?

For History  - its mapped as follows: 

IF T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('N','NQ') THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N'

Since history has all ACCOUNT_STATUS like A,I,T1,TO, N , NQ coming as source , so we decided to decode it to Y/N for history , else we need to derive it based on origination date and data date.
Let me know , we have to do the derivation in History also? And what do we decode the other ACCOUNT_STATUSES to (A,I, etc...)?


For ACCT_INACT_CHG_IND the logic is

CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA','N') THEN 'YtoY' WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI','NQtoI') THEN 'YtoN' ELSE 'NtoY' END

Since CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS  = 'N' i.e NEW , so its decoded to 'YtoY'.
If the change account status is 'N' , Current account status = I (Inactive) seems to be wrong.

I am checking this in other LOB's.

Henry,

Since we are hardcoding the !!NA & !!UNK foreign keys, testing team has written scripts for validating these keys. In these validation scripts, we do ont have any hardcoding, but actual joins. Thus, any wrong hardcoding will be pointed out in testing.
In fact, during our testing in DEV, testing team pointed few such descripancies which we corrected. This is recorded in test log as well.
I will send all test scripts which show testing for !!NA & !!UNK keys. But following is a sample:

kishor,

Sounds like communication is the key here.   I've talked with Seema and Beth and neither were aware of the issues or the direction taken here.  The code we had written as working examples was not used. 

I just communicated today with Praveen the kinds of tests that would need to be done to verify that we don't have problems with this shortcut.   He was not aware of this issue.  I've looked at the current scripts - nothing was there yet to verify this. 

What I suggested to Seema is that you compare the original working dimension tables that you initially used for hardcoding and compare them against the ones now in the real schema to see exactly what is different.   That should point you to places exactly to look.    

To be clear, I am not suggesting that we add these joins back in at this juncture.   We just need to make sure that the hardcoding is in sync with the tables.   Both with due diligence on developer part and additional testing from Test team.

Henry,

We know that Surrogate keys are supposed to change and all our initial scripts were with actual joins and not hardcoding.
Reason why we chose to hardcode was:
1. DB2 was giving an error of 'SQL is suboptimal' and when we reduced number of joins, SQL ran fine. This was primary reason. We spent few days working around this, but could not get SQL with joins working.
2. Already our SQLs are complex and take long time. In most cases adding 6-7 more joins was making it take too long.

On the other side, testing team has test scripts for foreign keys and any such descripancy will come out during testing.
Also, when we are loading in CCRMDEV again, we are verifying the keys again.

Thanks,

Surrogate keys are just that.   Keys that could change at any time and have no meaning.  They absolutely should not be hardcoded anywhere at all in a single Informatica mapping.  

I'm not sure of why you guys choose to hardcode keys in history loads, it could  be for performance or simplicity sake.   It is way too late to pull joins back in now, but you must ensure that the hardcoded keys actually match the tables as they are now in MART_CCRM on CCRMDEV.  Beth, please confirm, that what is there now in these dimensions will get moved with key consistency to TEST.  

We will perhaps have to revive several of these 'one-time' scripts for phase 2 to add train-2 columns and rerun.   We will need to look at this again then.

They could have changed.  There had been a couple of !!UNK or !!NA fields that got added to the tables late.  Surrogate keys are not transferred over.  In theory, for all the table with SRC_STM_CD as part of NK, the SK should be the same number in all the tables. 

For example, for CLS -3 should be !!UNK in all the tables and -4 should be the !!NA.  But SK should have never been hard coded in the scripts.  I don't believe the scripts that Henry and I wrote there is any hard coding for SKs.

The query in the test case document does not have the coalesce.   I do see how this would show you differences though between the source matching and the target that was created.   Good job.    One observation would be though that you are comparing F_CRED_FACLT against D_CRED_FACLT in effect to make sure that their ids match.

I'm not sure of why you guys choose to hardcode keys in history loads, it could  be for performance or simplicity sake.   It is way too late to pull joins back in now, but you must ensure that the hardcoded keys actually match the tables as they are now in MART_CCRM on CCRMDEV.  Beth, please confirm, that what is there now in these dimensions will get moved with key consistency to TEST.  

We will perhaps have to revive several of these 'one-time' scripts for phase 2 to add train-2 columns and rerun.   We will need to look at this again then.

They could have changed.  There had been a couple of !!UNK or !!NA fields that got added to the tables late.  Surrogate keys are not transferred over.  In theory, for all the table with SRC_STM_CD as part of NK, the SK should be the same number in all the tables. 

For example, for CLS -3 should be !!UNK in all the tables and -4 should be the !!NA.  But SK should have never been hard coded in the scripts.  I don't believe the scripts that Henry and I wrote there is any hard coding for SKs.

Do you know when the table move happen?



Yesterday I had completed OBLGR, COLL, D_CRED_FCLT & F_CRED_FCLT for 5 LOBs. But when I checked today data for these LOBs is not present in MRT_CCRM.D_CRED_FCLT & MRT_CCRM.F_CRED_FCLT tables.



I finished loading data for 5 LOBs at around 1:30 PM EST yesterday and tables were moved to new tablespace at 2:30 PM EST.



Can you please check?

Question:  Why is anything greater than 2 considered 'NOT QUITE NEW'?  I would think after another couple of months, then it wouldn't be considered 'NOT QUITE NEW' any more.  It would seem strange to me for a loan that is several years old to be considered 'NOT QUITE NEW'.  I would think there is some cap and then anything over that is left NULL (unless Henry, would prefer to default it to something else like 'OLD' if you don't like having it null)..

For monthly, we need to only do the logic in one place.  It either happens in WRK to STG or STG to MRT. 

As discussed on the phone, they've already determined N and NQ in the ACCOUNT_STATUS.  We just translate those to 'NEW' and 'NOT QUITE NEW'  else NULL (or other default).  We need HISTORY to match as closely with the monthly process as possible other wise the data and reporting won't work well if we have different values loaded for HISTORY vs what we do for the monthly.

Hi Beth

In Monthly the NEW_IND is populates in STG-->MRT as

IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')<= 2 THEN 'NEW'
IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')> 2 'NOT QUITE NEW'

Its not there in WRK --> STG. However the field is there in MSTG_F_CRED_FCLT. So we need to add the same logic in WRK_STG layer also.
Was NEW_IND added in MSTG fact recently?

For History  - its mapped as follows: 

IF T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('N','NQ') THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N'

Since history has all ACCOUNT_STATUS like A,I,T1,TO, N , NQ coming as source , so we decided to decode it to Y/N for history , else we need to derive it based on origination date and data date.
Let me know , we have to do the derivation in History also? And what do we decode the other ACCOUNT_STATUSES to (A,I, etc...)?


For ACCT_INACT_CHG_IND the logic is

CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA','N') THEN 'YtoY' WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI','NQtoI') THEN 'YtoN' ELSE 'NtoY' END

Since CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS  = 'N' i.e NEW , so its decoded to 'YtoY'.
If the change account status is 'N' , Current account status = I (Inactive) seems to be wrong.

I am checking this in other LOB's.
Thanks & Regards

A couple of notes that I am seeing in the History scripts.

The New_indicator field is being set to 'Y'/'N', this isn't a flag field.  The values in this field should be 'NEW' /'N' or 'NOT QUITE NEW' /'NQ' (Seema, can you verify what we are doing for monthly).

Additionally the Active change status, need to make sure the record cannot have Active Status = 'I' with the ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS  = 'NtoY' or 'YtoY'
    for example in SFW we have records that Have a current status of 'I'  and a CHANGE STATUS = 'N', this is getting translated to ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS = 'YtoY'

Since we are hardcoding the !!NA & !!UNK foreign keys, testing team has written scripts for validating these keys. In these validation scripts, we do ont have any hardcoding, but actual joins. Thus, any wrong hardcoding will be pointed out in testing.
In fact, during our testing in DEV, testing team pointed few such descripancies which we corrected. This is recorded in test log as well.

kishor,

Sounds like communication is the key here.   I've talked with Seema and Beth and neither were aware of the issues or the direction taken here.  The code we had written as working examples was not used. 

I just communicated today with Praveen the kinds of tests that would need to be done to verify that we don't have problems with this shortcut.   He was not aware of this issue.  I've looked at the current scripts - nothing was there yet to verify this. 

What I suggested to Seema is that you compare the original working dimension tables that you initially used for hardcoding and compare them against the ones now in the real schema to see exactly what is different.   That should point you to places exactly to look.    

To be clear, I am not suggesting that we add these joins back in at this juncture.   We just need to make sure that the hardcoding is in sync with the tables.   Both with due diligence on developer part and additional testing from Test team.

Henry,

We know that Surrogate keys are supposed to change and all our initial scripts were with actual joins and not hardcoding.
Reason why we chose to hardcode was:
1. DB2 was giving an error of 'SQL is suboptimal' and when we reduced number of joins, SQL ran fine. This was primary reason. We spent few days working around this, but could not get SQL with joins working.
2. Already our SQLs are complex and take long time. In most cases adding 6-7 more joins was making it take too long.

On the other side, testing team has test scripts for foreign keys and any such descripancy will come out during testing.
Also, when we are loading in CCRMDEV again, we are verifying the keys again.

Thanks,

Beth,



Do you know when the table move happen?



Yesterday I had completed OBLGR, COLL, D_CRED_FCLT & F_CRED_FCLT for 5 LOBs. But when I checked today data for these LOBs is not present in MRT_CCRM.D_CRED_FCLT & MRT_CCRM.F_CRED_FCLT tables.



I finished loading data for 5 LOBs at around 1:30 PM EST yesterday and tables were moved to new tablespace at 2:30 PM EST.



Can you please check?



Thanks,

We know there is a lot of room for improvement in this mart.   Improvement we cannot possibly tackle right now.   I'm trusting someone to be keeping a list of the improvements that are needed as part of phase 2.  Who is doing this?   Or do I need to pick a volunteer. 

In short, if we are doing what they do now in SAS, good enough.   History must match monthly.   If we choose to make monthly different from SAS, then history load must convert to match monthly.

Question:  Why is anything greater than 2 considered 'NOT QUITE NEW'?  I would think after another couple of months, then it wouldn't be considered 'NOT QUITE NEW' any more.  It would seem strange to me for a loan that is several years old to be considered 'NOT QUITE NEW'.  I would think there is some cap and then anything over that is left NULL (unless Henry, would prefer to default it to something else like 'OLD' if you don't like having it null)..

For monthly, we need to only do the logic in one place.  It either happens in WRK to STG or STG to MRT. 

As discussed on the phone, they've already determined N and NQ in the ACCOUNT_STATUS.  We just translate those to 'NEW' and 'NOT QUITE NEW'  else NULL (or other default).  We need HISTORY to match as closely with the monthly process as possible other wise the data and reporting won't work well if we have different values loaded for HISTORY vs what we do for the monthly.

Hi Beth

In Monthly the NEW_IND is populates in STG-->MRT as

IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')<= 2 THEN 'NEW'
IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')> 2 'NOT QUITE NEW'

Its not there in WRK --> STG. However the field is there in MSTG_F_CRED_FCLT. So we need to add the same logic in WRK_STG layer also.
Was NEW_IND added in MSTG fact recently?

For History  - its mapped as follows: 

IF T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('N','NQ') THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N'

Since history has all ACCOUNT_STATUS like A,I,T1,TO, N , NQ coming as source , so we decided to decode it to Y/N for history , else we need to derive it based on origination date and data date.
Let me know , we have to do the derivation in History also? And what do we decode the other ACCOUNT_STATUSES to (A,I, etc...)?


For ACCT_INACT_CHG_IND the logic is

CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA','N') THEN 'YtoY' WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI','NQtoI') THEN 'YtoN' ELSE 'NtoY' END

Since CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS  = 'N' i.e NEW , so its decoded to 'YtoY'.
If the change account status is 'N' , Current account status = I (Inactive) seems to be wrong.

I am checking this in other LOB's.
Thanks & Regards

A couple of notes that I am seeing in the History scripts.

The New_indicator field is being set to 'Y'/'N', this isn't a flag field.  The values in this field should be 'NEW' /'N' or 'NOT QUITE NEW' /'NQ' (Seema, can you verify what we are doing for monthly).

Additionally the Active change status, need to make sure the record cannot have Active Status = 'I' with the ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS  = 'NtoY' or 'YtoY'
    for example in SFW we have records that Have a current status of 'I'  and a CHANGE STATUS = 'N', this is getting translated to ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS = 'YtoY'

select A.*

Select T1.DATA_DATE, T1.ARRANGEMENT_ID

  END                           AS ACT_INACT_FLG
, CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA','N') THEN 'YtoY'
       WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI ') THEN 'YtoN'
       WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IS NULL THEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS

Since we are hardcoding the !!NA & !!UNK foreign keys, testing team has written scripts for validating these keys. In these validation scripts, we do ont have any hardcoding, but actual joins. Thus, any wrong hardcoding will be pointed out in testing.
In fact, during our testing in DEV, testing team pointed few such descripancies which we corrected. This is recorded in test log as well.
I will send all test scripts which show testing for !!NA & !!UNK keys. But following is a sample:

kishor,

Sounds like communication is the key here.   I've talked with Seema and Beth and neither were aware of the issues or the direction taken here.  The code we had written as working examples was not used. 

I just communicated today with Praveen the kinds of tests that would need to be done to verify that we don't have problems with this shortcut.   He was not aware of this issue.  I've looked at the current scripts - nothing was there yet to verify this. 

What I suggested to Seema is that you compare the original working dimension tables that you initially used for hardcoding and compare them against the ones now in the real schema to see exactly what is different.   That should point you to places exactly to look.    

To be clear, I am not suggesting that we add these joins back in at this juncture.   We just need to make sure that the hardcoding is in sync with the tables.   Both with due diligence on developer part and additional testing from Test team.

Henry,

We know that Surrogate keys are supposed to change and all our initial scripts were with actual joins and not hardcoding.
Reason why we chose to hardcode was:
1. DB2 was giving an error of 'SQL is suboptimal' and when we reduced number of joins, SQL ran fine. This was primary reason. We spent few days working around this, but could not get SQL with joins working.
2. Already our SQLs are complex and take long time. In most cases adding 6-7 more joins was making it take too long.

On the other side, testing team has test scripts for foreign keys and any such descripancy will come out during testing.
Also, when we are loading in CCRMDEV again, we are verifying the keys again.

Thanks,

kishor

Surrogate keys are just that.   Keys that could change at any time and have no meaning.  They absolutely should not be hardcoded anywhere at all in a single Informatica mapping.  

I'm not sure of why you guys choose to hardcode keys in history loads, it could  be for performance or simplicity sake.   It is way too late to pull joins back in now, but you must ensure that the hardcoded keys actually match the tables as they are now in MART_CCRM on CCRMDEV.  Beth, please confirm, that what is there now in these dimensions will get moved with key consistency to TEST.  

We will perhaps have to revive several of these 'one-time' scripts for phase 2 to add train-2 columns and rerun.   We will need to look at this again then.

They could have changed.  There had been a couple of !!UNK or !!NA fields that got added to the tables late.  Surrogate keys are not transferred over.  In theory, for all the table with SRC_STM_CD as part of NK, the SK should be the same number in all the tables. 

For example, for CLS -3 should be !!UNK in all the tables and -4 should be the !!NA.  But SK should have never been hard coded in the scripts.  I don't believe the scripts that Henry and I wrote there is any hard coding for SKs.

I had a discussion with Beth and following are the changes to be done:
* NEW_IND in History should be derived as. This is the same as we are doing in Monthly.
                CASE WHEN T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS = 'N' THEN 'NEW' WHEN T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS = 'NQ' THEN 'NOT QUITE NEW' ELSE NULL END;
* NEW_IND is present in MSTG as well as MRT fact and we have the transformation logic in STG --> MRT mapping document .
		IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')<= 2 THEN 'NEW'
		IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')> 2 'NOT QUITE NEW'
I checked the WRK to STG informatica mappings and its derived there but missing in mapdocs. But this was not mentioned in line by line review comment for any mapping. I will add this in all mapdocs.We should be fine if its derived at one place consistently for all LOB's.
* ACCT_INACT_CHG_IND  in History should be
	CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA') THEN 'YtoY' WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI','NQtoI') THEN 'YtoN' WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('ItoA') THEN 'NtoY' ELSE NULL END

Since 'N' and null does not indicate that there has been any change and we dont have any prev status,it will be decoded to NULL

I will try to update all History Mapdocs soon with these changes.

Hi Beth

In Monthly the NEW_IND is populates in STG-->MRT as

IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')<= 2 THEN 'NEW'
IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')> 2 'NOT QUITE NEW'

Its not there in WRK --> STG. However the field is there in MSTG_F_CRED_FCLT. So we need to add the same logic in WRK_STG layer also.
Was NEW_IND added in MSTG fact recently?

For History  - its mapped as follows: 

IF T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('N','NQ') THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N'

Since history has all ACCOUNT_STATUS like A,I,T1,TO, N , NQ coming as source , so we decided to decode it to Y/N for history , else we need to derive it based on origination date and data date.
Let me know , we have to do the derivation in History also? And what do we decode the other ACCOUNT_STATUSES to (A,I, etc...)?


For ACCT_INACT_CHG_IND the logic is

CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA','N') THEN 'YtoY' WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI','NQtoI') THEN 'YtoN' ELSE 'NtoY' END

Since CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS  = 'N' i.e NEW , so its decoded to 'YtoY'.
If the change account status is 'N' , Current account status = I (Inactive) seems to be wrong.

I am checking this in other LOB's.
Thanks & Regards

A couple of notes that I am seeing in the History scripts.

The New_indicator field is being set to 'Y'/'N', this isn't a flag field.  The values in this field should be 'NEW' /'N' or 'NOT QUITE NEW' /'NQ' (Seema, can you verify what we are doing for monthly).

Additionally the Active change status, need to make sure the record cannot have Active Status = 'I' with the ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS  = 'NtoY' or 'YtoY'
    for example in SFW we have records that Have a current status of 'I'  and a CHANGE STATUS = 'N', this is getting translated to ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS = 'YtoY'

select A.*
from (
Select T1.DATA_DATE, T1.ARRANGEMENT_ID
, T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS
, T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS
, CASE WHEN T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ( 'A' ,'N' , 'NQ' ) THEN 'Y'
       ELSE 'N'
  END                           AS ACT_INACT_FLG
, CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA','N') THEN 'YtoY'
       WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI ') THEN 'YtoN'
       WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IS NULL THEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS
       ELSE 'NtoY'
  END                           AS ACT_INACT_CHNG_IND
 from X_HST.SFW_FULL_DS T1
WHERE  T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS NOT IN( 'A' ,'N' , 'NQ' )
AND T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS  IS NOT NULL
) a
where substr(A.ACT_INACT_CHNG_IND,4,1) = 'Y'

DATA_DATE     ARRANGEMENT_ID     CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS     CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS     ACT_INACT_FLG     ACT_INACT_CHNG_IND
2006-06-30         186125                         I                                                             N                                     N                             YtoY

Since we are hardcoding the !!NA & !!UNK foreign keys, testing team has written scripts for validating these keys. In these validation scripts, we do ont have any hardcoding, but actual joins. Thus, any wrong hardcoding will be pointed out in testing.
In fact, during our testing in DEV, testing team pointed few such descripancies which we corrected. This is recorded in test log as well.
I will send all test scripts which show testing for !!NA & !!UNK keys. But following is a sample:

kishor,

Sounds like communication is the key here.   I've talked with Seema and Beth and neither were aware of the issues or the direction taken here.  The code we had written as working examples was not used. 

I just communicated today with Praveen the kinds of tests that would need to be done to verify that we don't have problems with this shortcut.   He was not aware of this issue.  I've looked at the current scripts - nothing was there yet to verify this. 

What I suggested to Seema is that you compare the original working dimension tables that you initially used for hardcoding and compare them against the ones now in the real schema to see exactly what is different.   That should point you to places exactly to look.    

To be clear, I am not suggesting that we add these joins back in at this juncture.   We just need to make sure that the hardcoding is in sync with the tables.   Both with due diligence on developer part and additional testing from Test team.

Henry,

We know that Surrogate keys are supposed to change and all our initial scripts were with actual joins and not hardcoding.
Reason why we chose to hardcode was:
1. DB2 was giving an error of 'SQL is suboptimal' and when we reduced number of joins, SQL ran fine. This was primary reason. We spent few days working around this, but could not get SQL with joins working.
2. Already our SQLs are complex and take long time. In most cases adding 6-7 more joins was making it take too long.

On the other side, testing team has test scripts for foreign keys and any such descripancy will come out during testing.
Also, when we are loading in CCRMDEV again, we are verifying the keys again.

Thanks,

Surrogate keys are just that.   Keys that could change at any time and have no meaning.  They absolutely should not be hardcoded anywhere at all in a single Informatica mapping.  

I'm not sure of why you guys choose to hardcode keys in history loads, it could  be for performance or simplicity sake.   It is way too late to pull joins back in now, but you must ensure that the hardcoded keys actually match the tables as they are now in MART_CCRM on CCRMDEV.  Beth, please confirm, that what is there now in these dimensions will get moved with key consistency to TEST.  

We will perhaps have to revive several of these 'one-time' scripts for phase 2 to add train-2 columns and rerun.   We will need to look at this again then.

They could have changed.  There had been a couple of !!UNK or !!NA fields that got added to the tables late.  Surrogate keys are not transferred over.  In theory, for all the table with SRC_STM_CD as part of NK, the SK should be the same number in all the tables. 

For example, for CLS -3 should be !!UNK in all the tables and -4 should be the !!NA.  But SK should have never been hard coded in the scripts.  I don't believe the scripts that Henry and I wrote there is any hard coding for SKs.

I checked the WRK to STG informatica mappings and its derived there but missing in mapdocs. But this was not mentioned in line by line review comment for any mapping. I will add this in all mapdocs.We should be fine if its derived at one place consistently for all LOB's.
* ACCT_INACT_CHG_IND  in History should be
	CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA') THEN 'YtoY' WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI','NQtoI') THEN 'YtoN' WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('ItoA') THEN 'NtoY' ELSE NULL END

Since 'N' and null does not indicate that there has been any change and we dont have any prev status,it will be decoded to NULL

I will try to update all History Mapdocs soon with these changes.

Hi Beth

In Monthly the NEW_IND is populates in STG-->MRT as

IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')<= 2 THEN 'NEW'
IF DATEDIFF (NOTE_DT,RPT_PRD_DATE_DT,'MON')> 2 'NOT QUITE NEW'

Its not there in WRK --> STG. However the field is there in MSTG_F_CRED_FCLT. So we need to add the same logic in WRK_STG layer also.
Was NEW_IND added in MSTG fact recently?

For History  - its mapped as follows: 

IF T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('N','NQ') THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N'

Since history has all ACCOUNT_STATUS like A,I,T1,TO, N , NQ coming as source , so we decided to decode it to Y/N for history , else we need to derive it based on origination date and data date.
Let me know , we have to do the derivation in History also? And what do we decode the other ACCOUNT_STATUSES to (A,I, etc...)?


For ACCT_INACT_CHG_IND the logic is

CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA','N') THEN 'YtoY' WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI','NQtoI') THEN 'YtoN' ELSE 'NtoY' END

Since CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS  = 'N' i.e NEW , so its decoded to 'YtoY'.
If the change account status is 'N' , Current account status = I (Inactive) seems to be wrong.

I am checking this in other LOB's.
Thanks & Regards

A couple of notes that I am seeing in the History scripts.

The New_indicator field is being set to 'Y'/'N', this isn't a flag field.  The values in this field should be 'NEW' /'N' or 'NOT QUITE NEW' /'NQ' (Seema, can you verify what we are doing for monthly).

Additionally the Active change status, need to make sure the record cannot have Active Status = 'I' with the ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS  = 'NtoY' or 'YtoY'
    for example in SFW we have records that Have a current status of 'I'  and a CHANGE STATUS = 'N', this is getting translated to ACTIVE_CHANGE_STATUS = 'YtoY'

select A.*
from (
Select T1.DATA_DATE, T1.ARRANGEMENT_ID
, T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS
, T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS
, CASE WHEN T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ( 'A' ,'N' , 'NQ' ) THEN 'Y'
       ELSE 'N'
  END                           AS ACT_INACT_FLG
, CASE WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NQtoA','NtoA','N') THEN 'YtoY'
       WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IN ('NtoI','AtoI ') THEN 'YtoN'
       WHEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS IS NULL THEN T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS
       ELSE 'NtoY'
  END                           AS ACT_INACT_CHNG_IND
 from X_HST.SFW_FULL_DS T1
WHERE  T1.CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS NOT IN( 'A' ,'N' , 'NQ' )
AND T1.CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS  IS NOT NULL
) a
where substr(A.ACT_INACT_CHNG_IND,4,1) = 'Y'

DATA_DATE     ARRANGEMENT_ID     CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS     CHANGE_ACCOUNT_STATUS     ACT_INACT_FLG     ACT_INACT_CHNG_IND
2006-06-30         186125                         I                                                             N                                     N                             YtoY

Since we are hardcoding the !!NA & !!UNK foreign keys, testing team has written scripts for validating these keys. In these validation scripts, we do ont have any hardcoding, but actual joins. Thus, any wrong hardcoding will be pointed out in testing.
In fact, during our testing in DEV, testing team pointed few such descripancies which we corrected. This is recorded in test log as well.
I will send all test scripts which show testing for !!NA & !!UNK keys. But following is a sample:

kishor,

Sounds like communication is the key here.   I've talked with Seema and Beth and neither were aware of the issues or the direction taken here.  The code we had written as working examples was not used. 

I just communicated today with Praveen the kinds of tests that would need to be done to verify that we don't have problems with this shortcut.   He was not aware of this issue.  I've looked at the current scripts - nothing was there yet to verify this. 

What I suggested to Seema is that you compare the original working dimension tables that you initially used for hardcoding and compare them against the ones now in the real schema to see exactly what is different.   That should point you to places exactly to look.    

To be clear, I am not suggesting that we add these joins back in at this juncture.   We just need to make sure that the hardcoding is in sync with the tables.   Both with due diligence on developer part and additional testing from Test team.

Henry,

We know that Surrogate keys are supposed to change and all our initial scripts were with actual joins and not hardcoding.
Reason why we chose to hardcode was:
1. DB2 was giving an error of 'SQL is suboptimal' and when we reduced number of joins, SQL ran fine. This was primary reason. We spent few days working around this, but could not get SQL with joins working.
2. Already our SQLs are complex and take long time. In most cases adding 6-7 more joins was making it take too long.

On the other side, testing team has test scripts for foreign keys and any such descripancy will come out during testing.
Also, when we are loading in CCRMDEV again, we are verifying the keys again.

Thanks,

Surrogate keys are just that.   Keys that could change at any time and have no meaning.  They absolutely should not be hardcoded anywhere at all in a single Informatica mapping.  

I'm not sure of why you guys choose to hardcode keys in history loads, it could  be for performance or simplicity sake.   It is way too late to pull joins back in now, but you must ensure that the hardcoded keys actually match the tables as they are now in MART_CCRM on CCRMDEV.  Beth, please confirm, that what is there now in these dimensions will get moved with key consistency to TEST.  

We will perhaps have to revive several of these 'one-time' scripts for phase 2 to add train-2 columns and rerun.   We will need to look at this again then.

They could have changed.  There had been a couple of !!UNK or !!NA fields that got added to the tables late.  Surrogate keys are not transferred over.  In theory, for all the table with SRC_STM_CD as part of NK, the SK should be the same number in all the tables. 

For example, for CLS -3 should be !!UNK in all the tables and -4 should be the !!NA.  But SK should have never been hard coded in the scripts.  I don't believe the scripts that Henry and I wrote there is any hard coding for SKs.

Seema,

I think some of what was laid out below didn't get fully implemented through the entire CLS process.

1.  In the max_date script I see, it using Train 1 only to determine the max_dt.  We need to use the inner join with Train 2 to determine the max data date, and then add the CF records.  This will affect getting the max_dt for CRED_FCLT/COLLATERAL, and OBLGR (see my other email regarding the OBLGR issues).  We want the max_data_date for the latest valid record, between Train 1 and Train 2.  The records we are eliminating due to the inner join we don't want (except the CF records). 

2.  I see a separate script for D_CRED_FCLT for the 'CF' records, but I dont see anything for the FACT table or COLLATERAL we need to verify these records are getting loaded into both those tables as well.   And OBLGR depending on how they choose to implement, I believe the query I sent included the CF records in the same script, but they may choose to create a separate script.

I believe this will fix a some of the CLS issues.  I didn't go through all the CLS issues that were laid out after the OBLGR question, since you were looking into those. Let me know if this helps with any of our continuing CLS questions including the OBLGR issue.  If there are any other outstanding questions you need me to look into let me know.

After speaking with Melanie and doing a good bit of research into the data that results in this.  This is what we've decided we need to do.

The reason this is happening is when we have records in Train 1 that don't exist in Train 2.  What Melanie discovered is that they really don't want most of these records where there is no match.  Praveen this will effect your testing scripts as well.  This will be the case for both the D_CRED_FCLT and F_CRED_FCLT load.  Let me know if there are any questions.

This only pertains to COM data set (SBB dataset should be an inner join between Train 1 and Train 2 because there is no record difference there)

1.  Our fist insert query needs to do an Inner Join between Train 1 and Train 2.  All the records we don't want will not be loaded and we won't have any issues with the PRODUCT_KEY from Train 2 being NULL. 

2.  A second insert query (which should just be in the same script) needs to load records from Train1 where the APPLICATION_CODE = 'CF'

        -  If you look at the PRODUCT_CODE for these 609 records they all say FACTORS.  This is not applicable to be parsed to get the PRODUCT or LOB

        -  PRODUCT_HIER should be a join on PROD_HIER_CD = '!!UNK~!!UNK~!!UNK~!!UNK' and SRC_STM_CD = 'CLS'
        -  LOB_HIER should be a join on LOB_HIER_CD = 'HIST~COM~CF' and SRC_STM_CD = 'CLS'

All the records with the APPLICATION_CODE = 'CF' will have updated ARRANGEMENT_ID coming from Melanie.  We need to make sure we have that corrected for the data that we move to the Test environment.

I will take a look at this OBLGR issue and discuss with Sunil as what they have implemented and what's missed as far as max date and CF is concerned. I did not go through the CF thing in detail yet.

The next 2 issues after OBLGR are resolved and I have replied to Sunil (LTV percentage was one which we discussed and came to a conclusion).

Seema,

I think some of what was laid out below didn't get fully implemented through the entire CLS process.

1.  In the max_date script I see, it using Train 1 only to determine the max_dt.  We need to use the inner join with Train 2 to determine the max data date, and then add the CF records.  This will affect getting the max_dt for CRED_FCLT/COLLATERAL, and OBLGR (see my other email regarding the OBLGR issues).  We want the max_data_date for the latest valid record, between Train 1 and Train 2.  The records we are eliminating due to the inner join we don't want (except the CF records). 

2.  I see a separate script for D_CRED_FCLT for the 'CF' records, but I dont see anything for the FACT table or COLLATERAL we need to verify these records are getting loaded into both those tables as well.   And OBLGR depending on how they choose to implement, I believe the query I sent included the CF records in the same script, but they may choose to create a separate script.

I believe this will fix a some of the CLS issues.  I didn't go through all the CLS issues that were laid out after the OBLGR question, since you were looking into those. Let me know if this helps with any of our continuing CLS questions including the OBLGR issue.  If there are any other outstanding questions you need me to look into let me know.

Beth

After speaking with Melanie and doing a good bit of research into the data that results in this.  This is what we've decided we need to do.

The reason this is happening is when we have records in Train 1 that don't exist in Train 2.  What Melanie discovered is that they really don't want most of these records where there is no match.  Praveen this will effect your testing scripts as well.  This will be the case for both the D_CRED_FCLT and F_CRED_FCLT load.  Let me know if there are any questions.

This only pertains to COM data set (SBB dataset should be an inner join between Train 1 and Train 2 because there is no record difference there)

1.  Our fist insert query needs to do an Inner Join between Train 1 and Train 2.  All the records we don't want will not be loaded and we won't have any issues with the PRODUCT_KEY from Train 2 being NULL. 

2.  A second insert query (which should just be in the same script) needs to load records from Train1 where the APPLICATION_CODE = 'CF'

        -  If you look at the PRODUCT_CODE for these 609 records they all say FACTORS.  This is not applicable to be parsed to get the PRODUCT or LOB

        -  PRODUCT_HIER should be a join on PROD_HIER_CD = '!!UNK~!!UNK~!!UNK~!!UNK' and SRC_STM_CD = 'CLS'
        -  LOB_HIER should be a join on LOB_HIER_CD = 'HIST~COM~CF' and SRC_STM_CD = 'CLS'

All the records with the APPLICATION_CODE = 'CF' will have updated ARRANGEMENT_ID coming from Melanie.  We need to make sure we have that corrected for the data that we move to the Test environment.

Beth,

There are 241 Lob Hier codes not available in the X_HST_MRT_CCRM.D_LOB_HIER table for CLS
Can you please check it and load the same.
E.g

LOB_HIER_CD    
9~9~!UNK~8410270       
9~9~!UNK~8439070       
A~A~!UNK~2011770       
A~A~!UNK~6049170       
A~A~!UNK~6049270       
A~A~!UNK~6055670       

Join logic used is as below
SUBSTR(PRODUCT_CODE,4,1)||'~'||coalesce(SUBSTR(PRODUCT_CODE,5,1), '!!UNK') ||'~'|| coalesce(SUBSTR(PRODUCT_KEY,2,2),'!!UNK')  ||'~'|| REAL_COST_CENTER_NO = LOB.LOB_HIER_CD

1. ETLLOAD does not have LOAD access on CCRM database in TEST. Hence we could not load data in FULL_DS tables. We will start this once we get access
2. We are planning to load SAS datasets in crmdata1, crmdata2,crmdata3 directories. Is it OK? Which directory should be used for load scripts?


Thanks,

No progress on tracking down your transfer problem that I am aware of.  Unless you hear otherwise, we are out of business tonight also.   

Doug,

I am looking into compression algorithms that would not only speed this process, but might circumvent the problem.   Do you guys have a standard / experience with compatible compression and decompression software between windows and Unix.

Hi kishor,



I refer to my appended mail regarding Ramesh logging time to BB & T.



I understand that he is yet to get the project code from you because of which his Jan 09 time sheets are still pending.



I request you to provide him with the project code to enable him to complete his time entry without further delay.



Please let me know if there are any issues.

Subject:        Oblgr History scripts


There are a number of inconsistencies in the OBLGR code.
* Sometimes there are join to SRC_STM table and sometimes it is hardcoded. (minor detail)
* It was one thing to hardcode the SKs for CRED_FCLT and CRED_FCLT_MTH, there are 4 joins for OBLGR
CLS, DEP,DFP, EFS, ILS, LFS, MLS, MVS, PRT, RAC, SHF
* SKs are being hardcoded and joins are still happening, since we are doing the joins we shouldn't be hard coding the SKs.
* Hard coding of -1 for INDSTRY_CD_ID shouldn't be happening
* INDSTRY_CD_ID is a LEFT JOIN 
*         join should be on '!!NA' for systems where NOT APPLICABLE, and COALESCE(INDSTRY_CD_ID,-1) for system where we have NAICS codes, but there was not match  (CLS done correctly)
* Hard coding of -1 for OBLGR_TYPE, oblgr_type is by SOURCE_SYSTEM. -1 is not correct.   (LFS is done correctly)
DFP, RAC
* COALESCE(GEO.ZIP_GEO_ID, -2) is not correct, either it is !!NA and thus -2 or it is valid join and a NULL is !!UNKNOWN and thus -1 (CLS is done correctly)
CLS, DFP
* Does this not have a TAX_ID field coming from Train 2?  (If we do have TAX_IDs we need to make sure to get rid of any '-' in the field)
DEP,  EFS, ILS, LFS, MLS, MVS, PRT, SHF
* ZIP_GEO_ID should not be null
CLS
* Needs to be fixed dealing with joins for Train 1 and Train 2.. See CLS - OBLGR email..

It looks like that rule will work for history, but I'm not sure I want the same rule applied on go-forward monthly processing.  You mentioned it was only for history, but I just wanted to make sure.

What is our cut off to determine a valid number?  By looking at the data would you be comfortable with setting anything > 100 in either field to be NULL (this is for HISTORY only at this point)

Hey Beth -

For RAC - the PAYMENTS_MADE_LTD and TIME_30_DAYS_PAST_DUE only seem to contain invalid data in Feb.2008 (see attached).  I agree - we should leave these invalid values as NULL.  Also - just a reminder - we'll be re-loading the RAC T2 history probably by the end of this week (supposed to get all files by tomorrow) to eliminate dups (just want to make sure you retrieve the updated datasets once they're reloaded).

Melanie,

Any updates about the CLS records we talked about last week?

Also I think this may have been brought up before, but I am not sure and don't remember what the resolution was if we did.

For RAC History there are a number of what should be count fields which are obviously holding a mix of count and what looks to be amount data (PAYMENTS_MADE_LTD) or contain numbers too larger to be valid (TIME_30_DAYS_PAST_DUE).  This looks to only be a History problem, as in the HUB for the monthly load data from PAYMENTS_MADE_LTD appears to have values of 0 - 99 and TIME_30_DAYS_PAST_DUE has values 0 to 26.  I would like to leave these invalid values as NULL for history or we can translate them to 0, but I wouldn't want them necessarily confused with the records that did provide a valid 0.

In MLS (MLA) the LTV_RATIOs seem to get to unreasonable values.  This is a problem in both History and for the Monthly.  I have provide a sample of the data from both SAS and HUB for you to look at.  The size of some of these results are larger than the data type that has been created, and we need to know what we want to load.  Or if we need to adjust our logic for deriving the LTV Ratio.

Call if you have any questions.

Although it was working but you can not guarantee if UDD changes LOB_SGMT_NM to something else.

I updated the left hand side of the join as per AK1 and LOB_HIER_CD and missed the right part. Hence the confusion.

Ken was very excited about putting something together.  He is going in-front of senior management again in a couple weeks and would really like to be able to show an executive dashboard.  We are planning to get together the first part of next week to pick a particular subject area to focus on - for instance, Sale Finance delinquencies and charge-off by region, by product, etc.  He felt it would be important to keep it limited and focused. 

We are a go!!

Sam,

Ken was very excited about putting something together.  He is going in-front of senior management again in a couple weeks and would really like to be able to show an executive dashboard.  We are planning to get together the first part of next week to pick a particular subject area to focus on - for instance, Sale Finance delinquencies and charge-off by region, by product, etc.  He felt it would be important to keep it limited and focused. 

We are a go!!

Henry,



I spoke to Brad today and will call you.  We are 100% Go on developing the prototype and we need to pull together a team and process for managing delivery.  Brad is going to get an audience with Ken Daniels and then we will present it higher.



I know you have already been working on this and smoothing the way with IT as well.  Lets schedule a call either early Monday morning or early Tuesday morning our time  Monday evening would work as well.  



We want an executive dashboard type presentation in Microstrategy and we will do several rounds of review with Brad.  A first step might be to work with Santosh to develop written requirements that align with data we have today in CCRM development area.  I hope we can show some CRE asset quality metrics and perhaps some Small Business, for example.  Brad is thinking pretty basic blocking and tackling around Delinquencies.



If we have anything already developed that we believe should work, we should get all the screen shots produced and show them to Brad.



Anyway, I will call you at some point this afternoon to discuss and we can figure out how best to manage with so much else going on.  I think we may need a point person to run with it that is not you or me.

We need to decide on this. Process team has allocated a QL for GoldBank team.

As you know I had raised doubts about implementing processes at this point as we are towards end of project.



Can you please check with Deena and let us know project code on which Ramesh (QL) should bill?

Hi kishor,



I refer to my appended mail regarding Ramesh logging time to BB & T.



I understand that he is yet to get the project code from you because of which his Jan 09 time sheets are still pending.



I request you to provide him with the project code to enable him to complete his time entry without further delay.

Sam,
Certainly I'll be available for this and as I understand from the emails we need to move quickly on this, it will help if we can have a call on Monday to make sure everyone's on the same page with regards to timelines, functional aspects of the intended dashboard, its contents & data sources.

Henry,



I spoke to Brad today and will call you.  We are 100% Go on developing the prototype and we need to pull together a team and process for managing delivery.  Brad is going to get an audience with Ken Daniels and then we will present it higher.



I know you have already been working on this and smoothing the way with IT as well.  Lets schedule a call either early Monday morning or early Tuesday morning our time  Monday evening would work as well. 



We want an executive dashboard type presentation in Microstrategy and we will do several rounds of review with Brad.  A first step might be to work with Santosh to develop written requirements that align with data we have today in CCRM development area.  I hope we can show some CRE asset quality metrics and perhaps some Small Business, for example.  Brad is thinking pretty basic blocking and tackling around Delinquencies.



If we have anything already developed that we believe should work, we should get all the screen shots produced and show them to Brad.



Anyway, I will call you at some point this afternoon to discuss and we can figure out how best to manage with so much else going on.  I think we may need a point person to run with it that is not you or me.



Regards,

Experience everywhere has shown that DB2 is fairly retarded in selecting MQT tables at query-time.  Plus, you'll have to worry about when to refresh them.   We will build physical aggregate tables when reports are defined and we know what level to build them at.   MS is very capable agg aware tool.

Henry,



Considering very slow response that we are currently getting from DB2 database in CCRMDEV and considering that we have multiple parallel activities going on (Some monthly loads, history loads  although it will get over by the time reporting starts, testing etc), do you think we should consider following approach?



1. Create Materialized Query tables in DB2 on top of CCRM data mart. These will have data summarized at the level required for reporting. Also, only required data will be present.
2. Try if reporting against MQT in DB2 is fast, else port these tables to some other RDBMS (or may be on DB2 but in some other server).


This will help overloading development server with reporting activities and also faster development cycle on reports.



Thanks,

Henry / kishor:



Can one of you provide me with a brief description on the portfolio. The things I am looking for are:

1.       What is the portfolio covering? Ie CRE/ Retail/ etc.

2.       What is the history available?

3.       What are the product types ie Mortgages / revolvers?

4.       Is the rating information (Grade / PD / LGD ) available?

5.       What are the Amounts available? (Legal outstandings / total exposure / book balance)?

6.       What are the loss measures available (CO / Delinquency amounts / Delinquency flags / buckets)?

7.       What are the credit risk factor information available (FICO score / ratios/ etc.)?



If you can provide me with a brief sample of the data it will be a big plus.



kishor /Bhaskar: Can you send me the latest version of the MS dashboards in a PDF form?



I am hoping to provide the group with some ideas / designs with this information.



Sam:  Based on the emails is Vishal the point person who we should funnel all the information to?

Just a note to let you know that we held an internal progress review this morning.  We have our PM and Microstrategy developers ready to go.  Santosh is working with the team to provide requirements and working with Henry to make sure we understand the limitations of the data and infrastructure.



Do you want to participate in a call on Wednesday morning to provide some oversight and feedback?  We will be sending you our scenario requirements beforehand, but any guidance or insight you have is obviously valuable.  Our initial start is to focus on CRE, but also to show some example of how easy cross-portfolio reporting will be in the new system. I am thinking perhaps 4 core visualizations on the dashboard, with a little drill-down/drill-across story for each.  



Finally, I will get you some screenshots of what we have already developed in the old prototype.

Just one flag (RESTRCT_FLG) in d_cred_fclt- Its your call to do an update/reload now or later.

For CLS the logic would be
--coalesce(T1.CURRENT_RESTRUCTURED_STATUS ,  'U'),
CASE WHEN T2.RESTRUCTURED_STATUS = 'C' THEN 'Y' WHEN 'W' THEN 'N' ELSE 'U' END;

Another field thats potentially affected is CHANGE_RESTRUCTURED_STATUS which is NULL in History. But thats fine with Melanie to leave it like that since Train 2 does not have any Change field from where we can source it.And there is no point in deriving it in History data.


This can be derived on the fly for History as long as we have the RESTRCT_FLG populated as per the logic mentioned above.

For Monthly anyways we are getting both the fields populated correctly.

No. Since History had data based on Train 1 conversion

Current_Restructured_Status = 'U';

It will be 'U' - or undefined.

 RESTRUCTURED_STATUS  = 'W';                                                   

Which one has to be taken for CLS?

If Train 2 logic has to be taken then we need to decode 'C' and 'W' into Y/N as its a flag.

Praveen,

Like I said earlier, we will put more structure and definition around our expectations for UAT.  I have attached a number of reports we are planning to replicate for the various LOBs.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I am open on Wednesday morning, just let me know when.  It will be helpful to hear a bit more about what you guys are thinking before meeting with Ken and others on Wednesday afternoon on the same subject.

Brad,



Just a note to let you know that we held an internal progress review this morning.  We have our PM and Microstrategy developers ready to go.  Santosh is working with the team to provide requirements and working with Henry to make sure we understand the limitations of the data and infrastructure.



Do you want to participate in a call on Wednesday morning to provide some oversight and feedback?  We will be sending you our scenario requirements beforehand, but any guidance or insight you have is obviously valuable.  Our initial start is to focus on CRE, but also to show some example of how easy cross-portfolio reporting will be in the new system. I am thinking perhaps 4 core visualizations on the dashboard, with a little drill-down/drill-across story for each.  



Finally, I will get you some screenshots of what we have already developed in the old prototype.



Regards,

Subject: Reporting Requirements mockup



Santosh, Sam,



Please find enclosed a mockup of possible reporting requirements for our POC for GoldBank.



We have suggested 3 reports:

1. CRE report 
	1. Start with a distribution of exposures by LOB / portfolios
	2. Drill down to CRE and report by risk grade (this report is currently published as part of SAS reports, but it does not have much drill down capabilities)
	3. From CRE, drill down to either collateral or zip code
	4. From collateral / zip level data, drill to individual loan level


1. Delinquency distribution across portfolios 
Cross portfolio comparison was one of the wish lists of Ken. This kind of analysis is also mentioned by Brad in his mail (specifically for SFW)



1. Benchmarking against industry standards 
I dont think this kind of reporting is currently available in GoldBank. This report will compare delinquencies against industry averages available on feds website. For now, this can be a demo report and we can suggest getting industry data in CCRM in phase 2.



Since we have couple of weeks for this reporting demo, we are limiting number of analysis to 3. First and second analysis will actually have 3-4 different reports which can be opened by drilling. Thus the total number of reports will be 6-7.



Let us know your thoughts. We can incorporate any changes and send revised deck before tomorrows meeting with Brad.



Thanks,

Slide 2: CRE Report: Specify what the $ is (Total exposure etc. ) also % of portfolio should be by count and by $. You will need to add a column for that.

Slide 3: For the delinquency table: Have 2 tables. One by count and the other by $ also for these the delinquency bucket % is key as the count is meaningless without the total.



Slide #: Have a to 10 by dollar table for Slide 2 and 3. It is very impactful when they see customer names.

Subject: FW: CLS - Train 1 and Train 2 Restructured Status



I was talking about this change.
Just one flag (RESTRCT_FLG) in d_cred_fclt- Its your call to do an update/reload now or later.

For CLS the logic would be
--coalesce(T1.CURRENT_RESTRUCTURED_STATUS ,  'U'),
CASE WHEN T2.RESTRUCTURED_STATUS = 'C' THEN 'Y' WHEN 'W' THEN 'N' ELSE 'U' END;

Another field thats potentially affected is CHANGE_RESTRUCTURED_STATUS which is NULL in History. But thats fine with Melanie to leave it like that since Train 2 does not have any Change field from where we can source it.And there is no point in deriving it in History data.


This can be derived on the fly for History as long as we have the RESTRCT_FLG populated as per the logic mentioned above.

For Monthly anyways we are getting both the fields populated correctly.

Thanks & Regards

What about the Restructured_Status from Train 2 history?  Can't you use this field to derive the \"Y\" or \"N\" values?

Hi Melanie

No. Since History had data based on Train 1 conversion

Current_Restructured_Status = 'U';

It will be 'U' - or undefined.

For history - you're going to convert to Y or N also - correct?

This logic can be updated to:
IF (CLBS01_CHARGE_OFFS_LTD > 0) OR (CLBS01_WRITE_DOWNS_LTD > 0) THEN                                           
 RESTRUCTURED_STATUS  = 'Y';                                                   
ELSE
 RESTRUCTURED_STATUS  = 'N';                                                   

As long as we're still able to identify charge-offs and write-downs elsewhere we should be OK.  Can you verify?

Hi Melanie

CLS Train 1

CRM_RESTRUCTURED_STATUS = ' ';
Current_Restructured_Status = 'U';

CLS Train 2

IF (CLBS01_CHARGE_OFFS_LTD > 0) THEN                                           
 RESTRUCTURED_STATUS  = 'C';                                                   
ELSE IF CLBS01_WRITE_DOWNS_LTD > 0 THEN                                        
 RESTRUCTURED_STATUS  = 'W';                                                   

Which one has to be taken for CLS?

If Train 2 logic has to be taken then we need to decode 'C' and 'W' into Y/N as its a flag.

Thanks & Regards

Subject: Reporting Requirements mockup



Santosh, Sam,



Please find enclosed a mockup of possible reporting requirements for our POC for GoldBank.



We have suggested 3 reports:

1. CRE report 
	1. Start with a distribution of exposures by LOB / portfolios
	2. Drill down to CRE and report by risk grade (this report is currently published as part of SAS reports, but it does not have much drill down capabilities)
	3. From CRE, drill down to either collateral or zip code
	4. From collateral / zip level data, drill to individual loan level


1. Delinquency distribution across portfolios 
Cross portfolio comparison was one of the wish lists of Ken. This kind of analysis is also mentioned by Brad in his mail (specifically for SFW)



1. Benchmarking against industry standards 
I dont think this kind of reporting is currently available in GoldBank. This report will compare delinquencies against industry averages available on feds website. For now, this can be a demo report and we can suggest getting industry data in CCRM in phase 2.



Since we have couple of weeks for this reporting demo, we are limiting number of analysis to 3. First and second analysis will actually have 3-4 different reports which can be opened by drilling. Thus the total number of reports will be 6-7.



Let us know your thoughts. We can incorporate any changes and send revised deck before tomorrows meeting with Brad.



Thanks,

We have added one more report. Please refer slide number 6. It is an executive dashboard which presents important parameters of CRE portfolio in a single dashboard. From there, one can drill to lower granularity.

Attaches is a sample dashboard which I have made based on the conversations this morning. 

I have divided into sections:

1.      The Portfolio Overview Section is to provide balances by different dimensions. We can also have % of the portfolio in the table.  The bottom section has the alternative dimensions which can be used. (Q: can we cross tab this table to the other dimensions? Eg. Drill down to identify product concentrations in a lob)

2.      The Credit Quality Trends can have delinquency rates (as a line graph), balances by delinquency buckets and Scores as a table . (Question: Can we cross tab this to geography or some of the other dimensions as a path or drill thru? Eg. I can easily see us trying to find out the high delinquency areas.)

3.      The Geographic Concentrations can be at a state, region (as Brad mentioned) or MSA (if the data is available)

4.      Section 4 is the option to access canned reports. We can pick a couple from the list which Henry sent out.


Brad / Sam: Please let the team know your high level comments.

Henry / kishor: Please comment if the work is feasible in the given time frame.

Bhaskar / Sandesh: I have tried to use the dimensions which were provided. Let me know if there are any questions.

Now I have this distribution list on my GoldBank account.   Can't get to webmail from within here.  There are two documents.

1) is the IBM BDW (enterprise data warehouse) document.   This is the ETL architecture.  This effort started 18 months ago and finished 6 months ago.   This is what has been put on the back burner.   They only sourced two systems into the \"USM\".  This was an internal IT project.  Cap had limited responsibility in this project - the USM to BDW layer and the overall architecture. 

2) The data mart is the architecture for the project we are currently engaged in.  You'll note that it does provide provisions for populating the USM.  This is a user funded project.   Cap has full responsibility for the complete deliverable here.

When the history is reloaded , please apply this logic and load 3 months of data for one lob and Anand should load the monthly data for the same lob on top of that.

If these two matches and we tally the amounts with history. Then the PAID_STATUS_CALC is resolved.

Hi kishor

Mentioned below is the incorrect mapping in the history done.I mean this is not as per the Monthly done and also not as per sas inventory.

This was not raised as the defect in testing because of two reasons I can think of

* PAID_STATUS_CALC and PAID_STATUS_REASON in history has same values i.e 'PREPAID' and 'PAID'. Although PRIME has an extra value of PAID_STATUS_REASON i.e.'DNP'
* Need to check the test cases for these two fields.
This needs to be corrected. Since we have few LOB's in DEV box still to be loaded. We can change this for one of the smallest LOB's and thoroughly test it against sas data.

Melanie is doing the UAT on DEV data but she also did not raise this as a defect yet reason being point (1) mentioned above.

Let me know how do we want to correct it.

Incorrect mapping:

'PAYMENT' AS PYMT_STATUS_IND,

LEFT JOIN MRT_CCRM.D_STATUS_REASON STATPAY
on STATPAY.STATUS_RSN_CD = COALESCE (UPPER(A.PAID_STATUS_CALC) , '!!UNK')

This wont come as a defect even in History SIT , because given the scenario of history data - its not a defect.

Check this query for all full ds , it returns PAID , PREPAID , null
Select DISTINCT CURRENT_STATUS_REASON, PAID_STATUS_REASON, PAID_STATUS_CALC from HST.<LOB>_FULL_DS
* PAID_STATUS_CALC and PAID_STATUS_REASON in history has same values i.e 'PREPAID' and 'PAID' and dimension is populated with these values for PAYMENT_STATUS_RSN_IND = 'PAYMENT' for all source systems.
* History will work perfectly fine without any defect as long as the payment status gets a match in dimension.(PAID/PREAPAID/!!NA or !!UNK))
* Currently the fact has just history data. It will get a mismatch when monthly is loaded on top of history.
* We need not promote this change in this SIT cycle. We will test this throughly on DEV along with monthly and then should promote.
* For PRIME in flat to sas code there is DNP. Its not there in full ds as one of the value. So we are good in history.
%if &sys=prime %then %do;

else if Paid_Status_Reason='Default'

then Paid_Status_Calc='DNP';

Seema,

We have made the 2 changes in all the fact scripts.
1. . Hardcoding for 'payment' has been changed to PAID_STATUS_CALC
2. Join condition has been changed for 'PAyment' status to PAID_STATUS_reason.

But we couldn't found the 'DNP' valus in th prime LOB as mentioned by you in the mail.


Also do we have to send the latest scripts to Beth. If yes then mugdha can send you/beth the updated scripts.

Melanie and I have reviewed your prototype and we like what you are proposing.  I will say that it is difficult for us to evaluate the proposal when things are still in a static state.  I feel like we will be much more helpful in your effort once we are able to see and play with the live dashboard.  Please keep us informed of your progress and let us know if we can assist you in any way.

For item 3 listed below - Senior management at GoldBank will be very familiar with the cost center structure for geographic concentration.  Henry is working to add this piece to our list of dimension.  GoldBank refers to the hierarchy as CCCRT and the breaks are similar to region --> city --> branch --> cost center.  I believe that a drill-down on CCCRT would be a real wow factors for senior leadership to see.  I don't believe MSA will be available for the commercial portfolio.

Thanks again for the help.

All,


Attaches is a sample dashboard which I have made based on the conversations this morning. 

I have divided into sections:

1.      The Portfolio Overview Section is to provide balances by different dimensions. We can also have % of the portfolio in the table.  The bottom section has the alternative dimensions which can be used. (Q: can we cross tab this table to the other dimensions? Eg. Drill down to identify product concentrations in a lob)

2.      The Credit Quality Trends can have delinquency rates (as a line graph), balances by delinquency buckets and Scores as a table . (Question: Can we cross tab this to geography or some of the other dimensions as a path or drill thru? Eg. I can easily see us trying to find out the high delinquency areas.)

3.      The Geographic Concentrations can be at a state, region (as Brad mentioned) or MSA (if the data is available)

4.      Section 4 is the option to access canned reports. We can pick a couple from the list which Henry sent out.


Brad / Sam: Please let the team know your high level comments.

Henry / kishor: Please comment if the work is feasible in the given time frame.

Bhaskar / Sandesh: I have tried to use the dimensions which were provided. Let me know if there are any questions.

Henry,



I hope you are OK with Ramesh billing 4 hours a week on US_Gbank003 (non billable). Can you please confirm?



Thanks,

kishor,



Thanks for your efforts to help us to resolve this.



As you know, still Rameshs Jan, 09 time sheets are pending due to this and this cannot be carried forward to March due to procedural issues like logging tickets, taking approval, updating them through back-end etc.,



If we are not able to resolve this by tomorrow, I have to escalate this to Rahul for resolution in view of the reasons explained above.


Thanks for your help and understanding.



Thanks and regards,

Henry,



We need to decide on this. Process team has allocated a QL for GoldBank team.

As you know I had raised doubts about implementing processes at this point as we are towards end of project.



Can you please check with Deena and let us know project code on which Ramesh (QL) should bill?



Thanks,

Hi kishor,



I refer to my appended mail regarding Ramesh logging time to BB & T.



I understand that he is yet to get the project code from you because of which his Jan 09 time sheets are still pending.



I request you to provide him with the project code to enable him to complete his time entry without further delay.



Please let me know if there are any issues.

Hi Parag,



Good that we have closed some of the gaps,

I have reviewed the updated sheet, still there are below mentioned gaps in the sheet.



Project Initiation tab

 - Project duration should be in terms of No of Working days  put only days Eg 140 or 180

 - Project Objectives is not filled  Need to be from Business Objectives.



Data Sheet tab

 - Size is not mentioned.

 - Rework efforts are not filled.  If the defects are not mentioned for a particular functionality than the rework effort should not be put in.For eg if rework efforts are logged against functionality common this says

    that these efforts are to close the defects or review comments, hence those defects should be reflected in the defect sheet  pleas call (if required).

 - Reason for SV is not mentioned  pls mention the reason for red cells.





We need to close the same before 3:30pm today, Let me if a meeting is required to close these gaps.

Hi Rahul,



This is an escalation regarding QL billability for GoldBank project.



As approved by you earlier, Ramesh Nikam is supporting this project from 19th Jan and need to log 4 hours per week of his time in this account.



In spite of our best efforts, myself and kishor were not able to sort it out because of which Rameshs time sheets are pending since Jan, 09.


Formally escalating this to you for resolution.



Request for your intervention.

Henry,



I hope you are OK with Ramesh billing 4 hours a week on US_Gbank003 (non billable). Can you please confirm?

kishor,



Thanks for your efforts to help us to resolve this.



As you know, still Rameshs Jan, 09 time sheets are pending due to this and this cannot be carried forward to March due to procedural issues like logging tickets, taking approval, updating them through back-end etc.,



If we are not able to resolve this by tomorrow, I have to escalate this to Rahul for resolution in view of the reasons explained above.


Thanks for your help and understanding.



Thanks and regards,

Henry,



We need to decide on this. Process team has allocated a QL for GoldBank team.

As you know I had raised doubts about implementing processes at this point as we are towards end of project.



Can you please check with Deena and let us know project code on which Ramesh (QL) should bill?



Thanks,

Hi kishor,



I refer to my appended mail regarding Ramesh logging time to BB & T.



I understand that he is yet to get the project code from you because of which his Jan 09 time sheets are still pending.



I request you to provide him with the project code to enable him to complete his time entry without further delay.

About the reports, the reports which we have are complex reports and we cannot write SQLs for them. We tried to write for one of them but almost all of them are based on the Account_status which is !!UNK in the history data and we dont have any monthly data loaded right now.

One report was based on product code, but we already have a sql which aggregates few AMT fields based on product code.



Not much progress on the Monthly (on dev) as we dont have data available. For manual testing cases in Monthly, we are waiting for the updated mapping documents. We need to update our monthly test cases as per the updated WRK-to-STG mapping documents.

kishor,

Please review estimates and make comments. 

Train-2 expansion is your estimate.  There were 8 systems at 114 man-weeks from your email.   This is on average just over 14 man-weeks per system.   The estimate above is for 2 system conversions to Train-2.   We'll get the rest in Phase 2. 

Hub modification is again your estimate.   After our emails last week, we bumped it up to 50 days.   This looks like 60 days though.   This also includes the build out of the hub itself - the estimate was doubled for that.   The hub is simple dbloads with the most complex being the split of very large inputs into multiple output tables because of column count.   If you want to take this down, let me know.  

GL is my estimate.   It is a fairly simple system which is almost dimensional to begin and we already have one of the key dimensions.   The biggest effort here will be in the roll up of loan data and the reconciliation between GL and loan data.  


So weigh in whether you can commit to these estimates  and / or make comments.   These are offshore hours.  If you believe some time is in excess, we may up some offshore rates and keep the same estimates to improve margin which is a bit low. 


Attached below is where I roughed out a staffing plan.  It includes the roll off plan for phase 1 at the top and the ramp up plan for phase a at the bottom along with some costing.   It is expected that we will use key resources for both projects at the same time.

Subject:        Extension at GoldBank


All,

The original plan at GoldBank called for production delivery during the week of April 6th.  GoldBank has had a number of environment issues that have caused us more than a week of delay.  Last week the GoldBank DBA actually erased our entire development database adding another week of delay because of the time required to reload three years of historical data.

The good news is that we were actually running under budgeted plan and this two week extension of the offshore team will not cause an overage of estimates to any significant degree.  This two week extension has been socialized with the management team at GoldBank.   There is also some hope that kishor and team can bring the date in some.

The bottom line is that we need to extend some offshore resources.  I need to maintain 3 of the existing developers and 3 testers on a billable basis until April 24th.  kishor will make decisions on who to extend. 

Finally, we are getting close to finalizing of the next phase of work at GoldBank.  We have verbal approval for an additional $300k which will hopefully be signed in the next two weeks.  This will take us to mid-June when we should have a larger commitment taking us through early next year.  With this first approval, our offshore staffing needs will grow to 10 or 12 persons in mid-March - doubling our current staffing level. 

This work seems certain enough that I would request that we hold all of the persons who have worked on GoldBank so that we minimize our ramp up effort for this next phase which should begin in just two weeks.   There is a huge overlap in the type of work being done and we are depending on this experience.  kishor can provide the exact numbers and names, but there were six developers in addition to the testers.   

Thanks,

For LFS 87 records had NULL datadate even after Melanie corrected the dataset (it seems her changes got overwritten as per the mail below).

There are 87 records with data date as NULL. Do we need o correct them as per the attached email you sent sometimes back or reject them in history?

Hi Melanie

We have JAN-2009 files in History missing for following LOB's

LFS - LENDMARK - I know you are working on this for Arrangement Id fix
DFP - SFW T2 - We dont have the JAN 2009 Train 2 file. However T1 is present which causes a disconnect.

I have approval to support Microstrategy and the reporting on the CCRMTEST box.   That will be the superior place to go bececause we are going to have to \"break\" development again as soon as we get into phase 1A.  This frees you guys up to load a subset of the data also to get you back into testing much quicker.

Henry,



I have made few changes to the estimates. Revised document is enclosed herewith.

Following are the changes made:



1. Offshore BA is at Lead Con level and hence billing rate does not need to be $32. It can be $27 (but you need to verify this with Gene)
2. I have split business analysis, development and testing hours by GL Modification, HUB Modification  and Train 2 expansion.
3. Extended offshore development lead till end of project (you can decide on this)
4. My concern is that we have lot of overlap between development and testing in phase 1A. It is a shorter phase and in such a short span having so much of overlap may not be good. To compensate for this, I have extended development and testing phase by 1 week. It will be good if we can extend by 1 more week if possible.


Overall, because of these changes, our total fees go up from $300680 to $329840. Out of 4 BAs which were all assumed at Lead Consultant level, we have 1 at Lead Con level, 2 at Senior Consultant level and 1 at Associate Consultant level. So this will bring down our cost a bit.

kishor,

Please review estimates and make comments. 

Train-2 expansion is your estimate.  There were 8 systems at 114 man-weeks from your email.   This is on average just over 14 man-weeks per system.   The estimate above is for 2 system conversions to Train-2.   We'll get the rest in Phase 2. 

Hub modification is again your estimate.   After our emails last week, we bumped it up to 50 days.   This looks like 60 days though.   This also includes the build out of the hub itself - the estimate was doubled for that.   The hub is simple dbloads with the most complex being the split of very large inputs into multiple output tables because of column count.   If you want to take this down, let me know.  

GL is my estimate.   It is a fairly simple system which is almost dimensional to begin and we already have one of the key dimensions.   The biggest effort here will be in the roll up of loan data and the reconciliation between GL and loan data.  



So weigh in whether you can commit to these estimates  and / or make comments.   These are offshore hours.  If you believe some time is in excess, we may up some offshore rates and keep the same estimates to improve margin which is a bit low. 



Attached below is where I roughed out a staffing plan.  It includes the roll off plan for phase 1 at the top and the ramp up plan for phase a at the bottom along with some costing.   It is expected that we will use key resources for both projects at the same time. 

<<CCRM Resource loading-work with forecast - 2009-03-02 phase 1a (3).xls>>
We can discuss on phone also if you want.

1) For the $32, I was just looking for some ways to improve our margin with rate - we still have to work within current contract though. 

2) We will get to a much more detailed project plan. 

3) We cut off ALL resources but one off shore support person at the end for the project.   Phase 1 had them falling off slowly over time.   We want the \"world to end\" this time so that they will have a concrete target for phase 2 approval and if it slips........

4)  We cannot extend the $ right now.   I have already had to scale back the work to meet Brad's expectations.   We went from four train-2 systems to two to meet this.  Your proposed extension of a week or two goes beyond our parameters.  To be clear, the allocated time (according to estimates) is in this plan, it is just in a three month.   If we increased the time, they we would need to reduce the staffing.   However, adding week to onshore time puts us over $.   I do want to shoot for a three month release plan to keep the interest going.  

On  the topic of overlap.   Yes there is a direct overlap of analysis / design for phase 1A and implementation / delivery for phase 1.  This is the way I am going to propose everything be done in phase 2.   We'll have two teams with one doing analysis / design of the next application while the other is implementing the prior application.  This should allow us to have a more consistent staffing level and enable us to keep specialized resources for the duration instead of roll off and on.  

Bottom line  is that if you feel this cannot be done in this short of time, we will have to reduce scope.  That will reduce our revenue also.  If you want to change the estimates you have given me - 114 weeks for train-2 and 50 weeks for Hub mod, we need a reason - new finding.   Brad has already seen these estimates.   What did we miss?  

Personally, I am MUCH more comfortable with this plan and estimates than the original phase 1.

OK. Lets go ahead with your plan.

I was not suggesting any revision from original estimates, but more about overlap between coding and testing in 1A itself. But if you are confident we can manage this, lets go ahead with it.

kishor, 



1) For the $32, I was just looking for some ways to improve our margin with rate - we still have to work within current contract though. 



2) We will get to a much more detailed project plan. 



3) We cut off ALL resources but one off shore support person at the end for the project.   Phase 1 had them falling off slowly over time.   We want the \"world to end\" this time so that they will have a concrete target for phase 2 approval and if it slips........



4)  We cannot extend the $ right now.   I have already had to scale back the work to meet Brad's expectations.   We went from four train-2 systems to two to meet this.  Your proposed extension of a week or two goes beyond our parameters.  To be clear, the allocated time (according to estimates) is in this plan, it is just in a three month.   If we increased the time, they we would need to reduce the staffing.   However, adding week to onshore time puts us over $.   I do want to shoot for a three month release plan to keep the interest going.  



On  the topic of overlap.   Yes there is a direct overlap of analysis / design for phase 1A and implementation / delivery for phase 1.  This is the way I am going to propose everything be done in phase 2.   We'll have two teams with one doing analysis / design of the next application while the other is implementing the prior application.  This should allow us to have a more consistent staffing level and enable us to keep specialized resources for the duration instead of roll off and on.  



Bottom line  is that if you feel this cannot be done in this short of time, we will have to reduce scope.  That will reduce our revenue also.  If you want to change the estimates you have given me - 114 weeks for train-2 and 50 weeks for Hub mod, we need a reason - new finding.   Brad has already seen these estimates.   What did we miss?  



Personally, I am MUCH more comfortable with this plan and estimates than the original phase 1.

Henry,



I have made few changes to the estimates. Revised document is enclosed herewith.

Following are the changes made:



1. Offshore BA is at Lead Con level and hence billing rate does not need to be $32. It can be $27 (but you need to verify this with Gene)
2. I have split business analysis, development and testing hours by GL Modification, HUB Modification  and Train 2 expansion.
3. Extended offshore development lead till end of project (you can decide on this)
4. My concern is that we have lot of overlap between development and testing in phase 1A. It is a shorter phase and in such a short span having so much of overlap may not be good. To compensate for this, I have extended development and testing phase by 1 week. It will be good if we can extend by 1 more week if possible.


Overall, because of these changes, our total fees go up from $300680 to $329840. Out of 4 BAs which were all assumed at Lead Consultant level, we have 1 at Lead Con level, 2 at Senior Consultant level and 1 at Associate Consultant level. So this will bring down our cost a bit.

kishor,

Please review estimates and make comments. 

Train-2 expansion is your estimate.  There were 8 systems at 114 man-weeks from your email.   This is on average just over 14 man-weeks per system.   The estimate above is for 2 system conversions to Train-2.   We'll get the rest in Phase 2. 

Hub modification is again your estimate.   After our emails last week, we bumped it up to 50 days.   This looks like 60 days though.   This also includes the build out of the hub itself - the estimate was doubled for that.   The hub is simple dbloads with the most complex being the split of very large inputs into multiple output tables because of column count.   If you want to take this down, let me know.  

GL is my estimate.   It is a fairly simple system which is almost dimensional to begin and we already have one of the key dimensions.   The biggest effort here will be in the roll up of loan data and the reconciliation between GL and loan data.  



So weigh in whether you can commit to these estimates  and / or make comments.   These are offshore hours.  If you believe some time is in excess, we may up some offshore rates and keep the same estimates to improve margin which is a bit low. 



Attached below is where I roughed out a staffing plan.  It includes the roll off plan for phase 1 at the top and the ramp up plan for phase a at the bottom along with some costing.   It is expected that we will use key resources for both projects at the same time.

We can discuss on phone also if you want.

Brad will no longer be reporting to Ken.   He will report to someone else and the role sounds like it might be greater - \"reporting across the enterprise\".   He is coming over this afternoon to discuss.

Hi Seema -

The NULL dates have been updated in CR_LEND.  I'm not sure how they were wiped out - but I don't think it should happen again going forward.  The monthly processing should only be adding current month's data and not be running through all of the extract files again.

I will check if we have the earlier copy of combined dataset. But if you can correct them in attached sheet, we will correct them in the dataset loaded in DB2without extracting it again. Its just 87 records so should be manageable.

Hi Melanie

We have JAN-2009 files in History missing for following LOB's

LFS - LENDMARK - I know you are working on this for Arrangement Id fix
DFP - SFW T2 - We dont have the JAN 2009 Train 2 file. However T1 is present which causes a disconnect.
EFS - EQFIN - Jan 2009 file is not created.

Let me know how do we process these 3 lob's for History and Jan 2009 data.

Thanks & Regards

Hi Parag,



Good that we have closed some of the gaps,

I have reviewed the updated sheet, still there are below mentioned gaps in the sheet.



Project Initiation tab

 - Project duration should be in terms of No of Working days  put only days Eg 140 or 180

 - Project Objectives is not filled  Need to be from Business Objectives.



Data Sheet tab

 - Size is not mentioned.

 - Rework efforts are not filled.  If the defects are not mentioned for a particular functionality than the rework effort should not be put in.For eg if rework efforts are logged against functionality common this says

    that these efforts are to close the defects or review comments, hence those defects should be reflected in the defect sheet  pleas call (if required).

 - Reason for SV is not mentioned  pls mention the reason for red cells.





We need to close the same before 3:30pm today, Let me if a meeting is required to close these gaps.

OK Sir. Its definitely our plan.
I have always been in favour of 'our plan' and 'our estimates'. So good we are on same page.

Let's not call this \"my\" plan.   If it is not \"our\" plan then we have some more work to do - quickly.   You were with me every step of the way to create these original estimates.  

I did ask Brad about $20k extra money.   He is very reluctant to go there.   They just got this approved.   So our adjustment will have to be to reduce scope.  

Look at this another way. 


	Train-2 Expansion 	GL ** my tweaking 	RMS 	Hub Modification *
	0.25 	1084 	2633 	480
	1140 	960 	0 	960


Keep in mind TWO train-2 systems - ILS and MLS.   Our estimates above add up to 3060 hours.  

2/8 * 114 weeks for Train-2 expansion and 50 days for Hub changes (note that this is really 60 days above)

The total hours in the project plan are 4480.   About a 45% contingency.  ONC and onshore are added to the original estimates.   We are also hoping to do a lot of report development as part of this. 

I understand your concern about the compressed time.   We need to make a plan for that from the beginning.   We do need to support three month release cycles though.

OK. Lets go ahead with your plan.

I was not suggesting any revision from original estimates, but more about overlap between coding and testing in 1A itself. But if you are confident we can manage this, lets go ahead with it.

kishor, 



1) For the $32, I was just looking for some ways to improve our margin with rate - we still have to work within current contract though. 



2) We will get to a much more detailed project plan. 



3) We cut off ALL resources but one off shore support person at the end for the project.   Phase 1 had them falling off slowly over time.   We want the \"world to end\" this time so that they will have a concrete target for phase 2 approval and if it slips........



4)  We cannot extend the $ right now.   I have already had to scale back the work to meet Brad's expectations.   We went from four train-2 systems to two to meet this.  Your proposed extension of a week or two goes beyond our parameters.  To be clear, the allocated time (according to estimates) is in this plan, it is just in a three month.   If we increased the time, they we would need to reduce the staffing.   However, adding week to onshore time puts us over $.   I do want to shoot for a three month release plan to keep the interest going.  



On  the topic of overlap.   Yes there is a direct overlap of analysis / design for phase 1A and implementation / delivery for phase 1.  This is the way I am going to propose everything be done in phase 2.   We'll have two teams with one doing analysis / design of the next application while the other is implementing the prior application.  This should allow us to have a more consistent staffing level and enable us to keep specialized resources for the duration instead of roll off and on.  



Bottom line  is that if you feel this cannot be done in this short of time, we will have to reduce scope.  That will reduce our revenue also.  If you want to change the estimates you have given me - 114 weeks for train-2 and 50 weeks for Hub mod, we need a reason - new finding.   Brad has already seen these estimates.   What did we miss?  



Personally, I am MUCH more comfortable with this plan and estimates than the original phase 1.

Henry,



I have made few changes to the estimates. Revised document is enclosed herewith.

Following are the changes made:



1. Offshore BA is at Lead Con level and hence billing rate does not need to be $32. It can be $27 (but you need to verify this with Gene)
2. I have split business analysis, development and testing hours by GL Modification, HUB Modification  and Train 2 expansion.
3. Extended offshore development lead till end of project (you can decide on this)
4. My concern is that we have lot of overlap between development and testing in phase 1A. It is a shorter phase and in such a short span having so much of overlap may not be good. To compensate for this, I have extended development and testing phase by 1 week. It will be good if we can extend by 1 more week if possible.


Overall, because of these changes, our total fees go up from $300680 to $329840. Out of 4 BAs which were all assumed at Lead Consultant level, we have 1 at Lead Con level, 2 at Senior Consultant level and 1 at Associate Consultant level. So this will bring down our cost a bit.

kishor,

Please review estimates and make comments. 

Train-2 expansion is your estimate.  There were 8 systems at 114 man-weeks from your email.   This is on average just over 14 man-weeks per system.   The estimate above is for 2 system conversions to Train-2.   We'll get the rest in Phase 2. 

Hub modification is again your estimate.   After our emails last week, we bumped it up to 50 days.   This looks like 60 days though.   This also includes the build out of the hub itself - the estimate was doubled for that.   The hub is simple dbloads with the most complex being the split of very large inputs into multiple output tables because of column count.   If you want to take this down, let me know.  

GL is my estimate.   It is a fairly simple system which is almost dimensional to begin and we already have one of the key dimensions.   The biggest effort here will be in the roll up of loan data and the reconciliation between GL and loan data.  



So weigh in whether you can commit to these estimates  and / or make comments.   These are offshore hours.  If you believe some time is in excess, we may up some offshore rates and keep the same estimates to improve margin which is a bit low. 



Attached below is where I roughed out a staffing plan.  It includes the roll off plan for phase 1 at the top and the ramp up plan for phase a at the bottom along with some costing.   It is expected that we will use key resources for both projects at the same time.

We can discuss on phone also if you want.

We have another pass to go at this for the project specific details and grammar, but the legal boilerplate is there and the $ are correct.   I hope this is satisfactory for what we need to go through a legal review.   I believe you will find it almost identical to the SOW we now have in place - SOW 008 for phase 1.   I'll also need to pass it this draft through GoldBank management for their review and tweaking.  The target is to get this signed in the next few days.

Deena, Sam,

I believe we will be able to improve our margin based on our original SOW 008 and rates based on titles.   We can up Seema's rate significantly and bump up some offshore resources by a couple of $ based on contract in place and still come close to our guidelines.   I'll run those calculations tomorrow.

Give me a call at 678 517 8738 or email if questions.

What this means is that the allocation for US_BGbank008 can be done up till 7th Apr 2009.

Any allocation beyond that would be done by creating a child opportunity for US_Gbank008 and allocate them there from 8th Apr to the roll off date.



Also in Inform the opportunity Phase 1A is entered as Fixed.



Henry: could you confirm the name of the resources, the roll off date and under which opportunity?

Does this mean that after we get new SOW, we have to get project code extended and then extend allocations in INFORM?

Hi Deena,



Any opportunity under Anirban’s portfolio cannot be extended.

A child opportunity would need to be created to accommodate the rest of the days.



As per the SOW (attached for your reference) this was only for Phase 1 and term of the project was 8th Sep 2008 ?30th Apr 2009.



The new INFORM Allocation rules does not permit us to do any allocations beyond the close date of the project.

kishor,

It sounds like they want some names on our resource planning sheet and I needed to break it down to individuals so that we could do more granular rates. 

Attached is my first cut of this where I picked names and put them in the plan.   Please look over and tell me any adjustments you would like to make. 

For example, I assumed that Anand would be a developer from start to finish.   I chose someone else to be just part of the ramp up.  

So let me know about specific names and I'll send this to Lloyd.

Seema,



1. Tables in MRT_CCRM schema have been created for fixing SIT defects.
2. In monthly mappings, if we use only 1 schema, we will need to test them one after another. For example, once we load RAC and if we find some testing defect, we need to get data out of credit facility tables and then reload it. Only way to get data out is to truncate as we can not delete data because of logging issue. Thus till RAC issue is fixed, we can not move on to next LOB. This will increase our timelines for completing testing.
Let us know if we should test one LOB after another and not in parallel.



Thanks,

Hi kishor

As I discussed with you :

* There are tables created in MRT_CCRM for testing i.e. D_CRED_FCLT_1 and F_CRED_FCLT_MTH_1. This is fine as you are going to drop them after SIT defect fix and test.
* There is another set of same table created under MSTG i.e. D_CRED_FCLT and F_CRED_FCLT_MTH. What are they for ?


If you want to create tables for testing , create and drop them in one schema. Dont use multiple schemas to test.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks & Regards

I have confirmed with Beth about the SIT defect resolution for ILS and DFP.
It will be a script change and NOT dimension change as I mentioned in the last email.

* ILS  - Since '00' is invalid value and LOSS reason is applicable for this LOB we should set it to !!UNK.
* DFP - Since the meaning is same , we will decode it to a value which is present in dimension i.e. INACTIVE  LOAN - NO REASON' .

Beth's no is
6787588925

My comments on the points:

ILS  - Since '00' is invalid value and LOSS reason is applicable for this LOB we should set it to !!UNK.

DFP - Since the meaning is same , we can decode it to INACTIVE  LOAN - NO REASON' .

You can confirm both these points with Beth.

Let me know if you want me to join the call.

Subject:        Status as of March - 03

Beth,


Please find the comments against the defects and updated scripts for changes suggested by Seema and defects.

1.      DFP
        --> Issue :- STATUS_RSN_ID is getting populated by NULL for STATUS_RSN_IND = 'STATUS'
                Anlaysis - CURRENT_STATUS_REASON from source contains value 'Inactive - No Reason' where as D_STATUS_REASON dimension has value 'INACTIVE  LOAN - NO REASON' .

                Resolution :- Need to update the dimension table  with correct value or need to insert the correct value.

        -->Other Changes :- changes as suggested by Seema in the mail attached.

2.      RAC

        --> Defects resolved :- Defect(#5) for incorrect collateral_type_cd population has been resolved. Attached is the output of verified test case.

        --> Other Changes   :- changes as suggested by Seema in the mail attached.

3.   EFS
        --> Defects resolved :- Defect(#1&4) found in dim and fact are solved and attached is the output of verified test case.

        --> Other Changes  :- changes as suggested by Seema in the mail attached..


4.   ILS

        --> Defects  :-   LOSS_STATUS_RSN_ID is getting populated by NULL in case of records where CHG_OFF_REASON column contains value '00'  which is not                      present in the D_STATUS_REASON dimension.

                        Resolution :- We need to insert '00' value in the D_STATUS_REASON Dimension        OR
                                                If this reason is invalid then we need to set it to '!!UNK' or '!!NA' in the script.

        --> Other Changes  :- changes for PYMT_STATUS_RSN_ID and PYMT_STATUS_IND << File: Retesting.txt >>  << File: SIT Final.zip >>  << Message: RAC,SFW and CLS changes >>


5.  CC

        --> Other Changes :- changes for PYMT_STATUS_RSN_ID and PYMT_STATUS_IND


Beth - Can you make the related Dim changes and let us know so that we can start the load of the LOB's.
Let us know in case you need more information
Can we have a quick call at 7.15 IST (i.e 8.45 AM) on conference id - 286157#

For the reports, we need to know which dimensions are going to be in use.   I would like to see you guys document that.

Option 1 - we have existing table structures to represent the data

	At that point, we need to verify that the dimension has been set up properly with hierarchies defined.   We know the database, so we can do that verification onshore.   We won't need to document because the microstrategy interface will show it.  

Then we will need to ensure that we have the data to support that report populated in the dimension.  If not, we can do it through the UDD and code.   We will walk Brad and Melanie through the process here also. 

Option 2 - we do not have exiting tables to represent the data
	For many of these things, we will be able to do it directly in the report layer.   For example, I believe we should be able to define past due buckets in the report.   We might have to repeat it in several reports, but I think that will be better than introducing Stuart right now because we don't know for sure if we will go the table direction or the metadata direction.  
	If we encounter something that we can't do in the report layer, please document what it is and why it can't be done in the report layer.   I'll be working a parallel path to enable VDI with MS desktop, but if not in time, we'll work here (based on that documentation) to get it defined through Stuart.

Hi Parag,



Good that we have closed some of the gaps,

I have reviewed the updated sheet, still there are below mentioned gaps in the sheet.



Project Initiation tab

 - Project duration should be in terms of No of Working days  put only days Eg 140 or 180

 - Project Objectives is not filled  Need to be from Business Objectives.



Data Sheet tab

 - Size is not mentioned.

 - Rework efforts are not filled.  If the defects are not mentioned for a particular functionality than the rework effort should not be put in.For eg if rework efforts are logged against functionality common this says

    that these efforts are to close the defects or review comments, hence those defects should be reflected in the defect sheet  pleas call (if required).

 - Reason for SV is not mentioned  pls mention the reason for red cells.





We need to close the same before 3:30pm today, Let me if a meeting is required to close these gaps.

Hi Parag,



Good that we have closed some of the gaps,

I have reviewed the updated sheet, still there are below mentioned gaps in the sheet.



Project Initiation tab

 - Project duration should be in terms of No of Working days  put only days Eg 140 or 180

 - Project Objectives is not filled  Need to be from Business Objectives.



Data Sheet tab

 - Size is not mentioned.

 - Rework efforts are not filled.  If the defects are not mentioned for a particular functionality than the rework effort should not be put in.For eg if rework efforts are logged against functionality common this says

    that these efforts are to close the defects or review comments, hence those defects should be reflected in the defect sheet  pleas call (if required).

 - Reason for SV is not mentioned  pls mention the reason for red cells.





We need to close the same before 3:30pm today, Let me if a meeting is required to close these gaps.





Thank You,

Here is where we need to start. 



For the reports, we need to know which dimensions are going to be in use.   I would like to see you guys document that.



Option 1 - we have existing table structures to represent the data



	At that point, we need to verify that the dimension has been set up properly with hierarchies defined.   We know the database, so we can do that verification onshore.   We won't need to document because the microstrategy interface will show it.  



	Then we will need to ensure that we have the data to support that report populated in the dimension.  If not, we can do it through the UDD and code.   We will walk Brad and Melanie through the process here also. 




Option 2 - we do not have exiting tables to represent the data

	For many of these things, we will be able to do it directly in the report layer.   For example, I believe we should be able to define past due buckets in the report.   We might have to repeat it in several reports, but I think that will be better than introducing Stuart right now because we don't know for sure if we will go the table direction or the metadata direction.  


	If we encounter something that we can't do in the report layer, please document what it is and why it can't be done in the report layer.   I'll be working a parallel path to enable VDI with MS desktop, but if not in time, we'll work here (based on that documentation) to get it defined through Stuart.

Muthu, Ramesh,



We are in last phase of project. We have lost 2 weeks of project because of database crash by client DBA. We have to recover these 2 weeks during next 2 weeks.

Secondly, as you might be aware, we have got verbal confirmation about phase 2 of the project and we are working on SOW.



With all these activities going on, do you think it is appropriate to go back and estimate size of phase 1 of project? Can it not be done once project is over?



Let me caution - any delay / time lost in this phase of project will critically hamper our chances of getting phase 2 of project.

Hi Parag,



Good that we have closed some of the gaps,

I have reviewed the updated sheet, still there are below mentioned gaps in the sheet.



Project Initiation tab

 - Project duration should be in terms of No of Working days  put only days Eg 140 or 180

 - Project Objectives is not filled  Need to be from Business Objectives.



Data Sheet tab

 - Size is not mentioned.

 - Rework efforts are not filled.  If the defects are not mentioned for a particular functionality than the rework effort should not be put in.For eg if rework efforts are logged against functionality common this says

    that these efforts are to close the defects or review comments, hence those defects should be reflected in the defect sheet  pleas call (if required).

 - Reason for SV is not mentioned  pls mention the reason for red cells.





We need to close the same before 3:30pm today, Let me if a meeting is required to close these gaps.

Project is projecting 2 weeks behind in completing coding (scheduled for 2/27). This is due to changes in architecture that we have driven as well as things taking longer to complete offshore

30th Jan 09:
Team is making progress. But still project is projecting 1 week behind in completing coding.  Team will be able to able to make the scheduled date of 2/27 given that they work extra hours to make up for overall delay

19th Feb 09:
readiness of test environment for 'History'
1) Project is running one week behind the schedule due to lack of readiness of the QA test environment from client side, the team at offshore is utilized to test the History part on dev environment.
2) The team has shared the updated Mpp on a daily basis with client,  however approval on the same is not yet obtained.

6th Feb 09:
Due to lack of readiness of the SIT test environment the overall schedule got postpone by one week, the environment got set up after a week, the team continued with SIT, during last week the development test data was dropped by the client and this caused a delay of another week.
The overall delay was discussed and communicated to the client, 
However the approval from client is not yet received. This may impact
the cost as the client is been billed for the two weeks.

19th Feb 09:
The delay in the readiness of the testing environment will delay the overall schedule by 1-2 weeks,
DP is reporting delay on a daily basis.  However the approval on the updated Mpp / overall delay is not yet obtained from Client.










6th Feb 09:
The overall delay is also posted in the client issue log (Intranet).  However the confirmation on the postponing of the schedule is not communicated to CG.

Metrics data for the project needs to be consolidated, this require raw measurements such as - effort data (Normal, reviews, rework), defect data, size and CRs data.

6th Feb 09:
Team has documented the effort data however the size is not yet calculated, kishor has agreed to send the metrics sheet with size by 9th Mar 09

Muthu, Ramesh,



We are in last phase of project. We have lost 2 weeks of project because of database crash by client DBA. We have to recover these 2 weeks during next 2 weeks.

Secondly, as you might be aware, we have got verbal confirmation about phase 2 of the project and we are working on SOW.



With all these activities going on, do you think it is appropriate to go back and estimate size of phase 1 of project? Can it not be done once project is over?



Let me caution - any delay / time lost in this phase of project will critically hamper our chances of getting phase 2 of project.



Thanks,



kishor Deshpande

Hi Parag / kishor,



I got the size data validated from the Estimatioan SMEs, this cannot be considered as a valid size for the project.



Lets meet tomorrow at 10:30am with the SME to discuss the best approach to arrive at size.

Hi Parag,



Good that we have closed some of the gaps,

I have reviewed the updated sheet, still there are below mentioned gaps in the sheet.



Project Initiation tab

 - Project duration should be in terms of No of Working days  put only days Eg 140 or 180

 - Project Objectives is not filled  Need to be from Business Objectives.



Data Sheet tab

 - Size is not mentioned.

 - Rework efforts are not filled.  If the defects are not mentioned for a particular functionality than the rework effort should not be put in.For eg if rework efforts are logged against functionality common this says

    that these efforts are to close the defects or review comments, hence those defects should be reflected in the defect sheet  pleas call (if required).

 - Reason for SV is not mentioned  pls mention the reason for red cells.





We need to close the same before 3:30pm today, Let me if a meeting is required to close these gaps.





Thank You,

Hi Sunil / Parag,



Here is the updated QL status report as on 6th Mar 09.

Project is projecting 2 weeks behind in completing coding (scheduled for 2/27). This is due to changes in architecture that we have driven as well as things taking longer to complete offshore

30th Jan 09:
Team is making progress. But still project is projecting 1 week behind in completing coding.  Team will be able to able to make the scheduled date of 2/27 given that they work extra hours to make up for overall delay

19th Feb 09:
readiness of test environment for 'History'
1) Project is running one week behind the schedule due to lack of readiness of the QA test environment from client side, the team at offshore is utilized to test the History part on dev environment.
2) The team has shared the updated Mpp on a daily basis with client,  however approval on the same is not yet obtained.

6th Feb 09:
Due to lack of readiness of the SIT test environment the overall schedule got postpone by one week, the environment got set up after a week, the team continued with SIT, during last week the development test data was dropped by the client and this caused a delay of another week.
The overall delay was discussed and communicated to the client, 
However the approval from client is not yet received. This may impact
the cost as the client is been billed for the two weeks.

Possible impact on project financials and high resource utilization

19th Feb 09:
The delay in the readiness of the testing environment will delay the overall schedule by 1-2 weeks,
DP is reporting delay on a daily basis.  However the approval on the updated Mpp / overall delay is not yet obtained from Client.










6th Feb 09:
The overall delay is also posted in the client issue log (Intranet).  However the confirmation on the postponing of the schedule is not communicated to CG.

Metrics data for the project needs to be consolidated, this require raw measurements such as - effort data (Normal, reviews, rework), defect data, size and CRs data.

6th Feb 09:
Team has documented the effort data however the size is not yet calculated, kishor has agreed to send the metrics sheet with size by 9th Mar 09

One last thing I forgot to mention.  These scenarios basically need to be check from WRK to MSTG and MSTG to UDD.  Test cases already written from UDD_COST_CENTER to MRT_COST_CENTER shouldn't need to change or be added to for these situations.

Praveen,

Here are some of the scenarios we will need to test for CCCRT.  It is a bit different than some of the other systems and much of what gets done happens in the Source Qualifier query and only a small amount of transformation actual happens in the informatica.  Seema, please chime in if there is something that you interpreted from Peggy's documentation differently than I did.


1. We want to get all distinct CTR_7D_NBR from WRK_CRT_GL_CENTER_PUB table.

2. In the WRK_CRT_GL_CENTER_PUB there can be numerous records for the same CTR_7D_NBR, we want the record with the latest CTR_EFF_DT.

3.  Getting Region and City information from the CCCRT rollup tables is the main basis of what we are looking to get from CCCRT.  If you look at the rollup table there are a number of rollup types, for our purposes (at least for now), I only looked for information for CITY and REGION.  Ideally we had a CITY child with REGION parent, but there were some cases where I did not find that rollup.  In those cases I still tired to get REGION information where it was the child. 

     --- this is the part of the query that addresses this part, not that your guys should use the same query I did because that won't necessary test that I did it correctly ----

$$wrk_schema.WRK_CRT_GL_CENTER_PUB C
Left join (             $$wrk_schema.WRK_CRT_GL_CTR_ROLLUP_PUB CR
     JOIN $$wrk_schema.WRK_CRT_GL_ROLLUP_PUB GR
       ON CR.CRUP_ROLLUP_NBR  = GR.ROLL_ROLLUP_NBR
      AND CR.CRUP_UNIT_TYP    = GR.ROLL_ROLLUP_TYP
      AND CR.PERIOD_ENDING_DT = GR.PERIOD_ENDING_DT
     JOIN $$wrk_schema.WRK_CRT_GL_ROLLUP_ROLLUP_PUB GRR_CTY_CTR
       ON GR.ROLL_ROLLUP_NBR  = GRR_CTY_CTR.RROL_CHILD_NBR
      AND GR.ROLL_ROLLUP_TYP  = GRR_CTY_CTR.RROL_CHILD_TYP
      AND GR.PERIOD_ENDING_DT = GRR_CTY_CTR.PERIOD_ENDING_DT
      AND GRR_CTY_CTR.RROL_CHILD_TYP  IN ('CITY/CTR', 'REGION')
     LEFT JOIN $$wrk_schema.WRK_CRT_GL_ROLLUP_PUB GR_REG
       ON GRR_CTY_CTR.RROL_PARENT_NBR  = GR_REG.ROLL_ROLLUP_NBR
      AND GRR_CTY_CTR.RROL_PARENT_TYP  = GR_REG.ROLL_ROLLUP_TYP
      AND GRR_CTY_CTR.PERIOD_ENDING_DT = GR_REG.PERIOD_ENDING_DT
      AND GRR_CTY_CTR.RROL_PARENT_TYP  = 'REGION'
)
ON  C.CTR_7D_NBR        = CR.CRUP_CTR_7D_NBR
 AND C.PERIOD_ENDING_DT  = CR.PERIOD_ENDING_DT

4.  Any Cost Centers that have been deleted are marked with CTR_TYP_IND = 'D'.  For those records we have to find what new Cost Center they have mapped to. According to Peggy's documentation, the way to find the corresponding new CTR_7D_NBR is by finding the matching CTR_5D_NBR with the latest CRT_EFF_DT and CTR_TYP_IND != 'D'.   This determines the new CMN_CST_CNTR_NBR in our table, while the SRC_CST_CNTR_NBR stays the original value.

5.  Cost Centers that have been merged into other Cost Centers are marked with CTR_TYP_IND = 'F'.  We need to get what new Cost Center they have been merged into.  According to Peggy's documentation, the way to find the corresponding new CTR_7D_NBR is by getting the CONS_NEW_CTR_NBR from the WRK_CRT_GL_CONS_CENTER_PUB table.  This determines the new CMN_CST_CNTR_NBR in our table, while the SRC_CST_CNTR_NBR stays the original value.

6.  All the City and Region information applies to the CMN_CST_CNTR_NBR and not the SRC_CST_CNTR_NBR, so for the two situations listed above, we need to make sure the City and Region information is for the new CMN_CST_CNTR_NBR and not the old CMN_SCT_CNTR_NBR or original SRC_SCT_CNTR_NBR.

7.  The WRK_CRT_GL_CENTER_PUB will keep 'D' and 'F' records for a year I believe is what Peggys documentation says, after that will no longer be provided.  We will need to make sure that if the CMN_CST_CNTR_NBR information (Region/City) at a later date changes we are still updating that information.

8.  Related to scenario 7 - If the CMN_CST_CNTR_NBR later gets deleted 'D' or merged 'F', it will need to get updated to the new CMN_CST_CNTR_NBR that the old CMN_CST_CNTR_NBR became or merged into. (Swait, I believe I have missed this condition in the mappings I have done. I will need to look at the MSTG to UDD mapping to figure out how to incorporate this situation).

To test scenario 7 and 8 we will want to Delete a couple of records that had CTR_TYP_IND = 'D' and 'F'. 
        For scenario 7 we will want to change either the actual REGION or CITY that new COST_CENTER rollups up to or change the descriptive information about either and verify that the information for all the SRC_CST_CNTR_NBRs that have that CMN_CST_CNTR_NBR are still getting updated. 

        For scenario 8 we will want to change the new CMN_CST_CNTR_NBR to CTR_TYP_IND = 'D' and/or 'F'.  And make sure we create new records accordingly.  For 'D' we would need a new record in WRK_CRT_GL_CENTER_PUB with same CTR_5D_NBR and would need associated records in the ROLLUP tables.  For 'F' we would need a new record added to the WRK_CRT_GL_CONS_CENTER_PUB table with the CTR_7D_NBR that we set CTR_TYP_IND = 'F' as CONS_OLD_CTR_NBR and we can pick any active current CTR_7D_NBR to put in the CONS_NEW_CTR_NBR.

I know that there will probably be a lot of questions around this and I have not explained everything as fully or as clearly as I need to, but I am hoping this will be a start to a dialogue and some questions from your team.

Hi Sunil / Parag,



Here is the updated QL status report as on 6th Mar 09.

Project is projecting 2 weeks behind in completing coding (scheduled for 2/27). This is due to changes in architecture that we have driven as well as things taking longer to complete offshore

30th Jan 09:
Team is making progress. But still project is projecting 1 week behind in completing coding.  Team will be able to able to make the scheduled date of 2/27 given that they work extra hours to make up for overall delay

19th Feb 09:
readiness of test environment for 'History'
1) Project is running one week behind the schedule due to lack of readiness of the QA test environment from client side, the team at offshore is utilized to test the History part on dev environment.
2) The team has shared the updated Mpp on a daily basis with client,  however approval on the same is not yet obtained.

6th Feb 09:
Due to lack of readiness of the SIT test environment the overall schedule got postpone by one week, the environment got set up after a week, the team continued with SIT, during last week the development test data was dropped by the client and this caused a delay of another week.
The overall delay was discussed and communicated to the client, 
However the approval from client is not yet received. This may impact
the cost as the client is been billed for the two weeks.

Possible impact on project financials and high resource utilization

19th Feb 09:
The delay in the readiness of the testing environment will delay the overall schedule by 1-2 weeks,
DP is reporting delay on a daily basis.  However the approval on the updated Mpp / overall delay is not yet obtained from Client.









6th Feb 09:
The overall delay is also posted in the client issue log (Intranet).  However the confirmation on the postponing of the schedule is not communicated to CG.

Metrics data for the project needs to be consolidated, this require raw measurements such as - effort data (Normal, reviews, rework), defect data, size and CRs data.

6th Feb 09:
Team has documented the effort data however the size is not yet calculated, kishor has agreed to send the metrics sheet with size by 9th Mar 09

Hi Henry,



Did you get a chance to look into this?



Looking at response time on TEST box, I think we should adopt following method:

1. Create a set of credit facility tables in DEV box specifically for reporting.
2. Load only CLS data in those tables.
3. Connect to DEV tables from MSTR.


Let me know if this is possible. Looking at activities going on in SIT, I dont think we should depend on SIT database.



Sam, we are facing some infrastructural issues. Though we have created some basic reports, we are not able to execute them.

Henry,

We have started working on MSTR reports. We created report of 'Priniple balance distribution by Product'. We had put a filter in the report to ensure that report is created only for 2 months data (this was for testing).

However, we could not execute the report as the report failed because of timeout error.

I think we need to create aggregate tables (as you have said, MSTR is a god aggregate aware tool) to make sure report runs faster.

Also, enclosed specifications list table columns that we have identified for reporting. For now, the attributes and metrices that you have created seem good to start creating reports.

SIT database should be much faster that DEV at this point.  The hardware is faster and dedicated. 

I'm sure you realize that for the 5 LOBs that have now passed, it is only after they were moved back to development for defect repairs.

Keep in mind that DEV will need to be totally replaced by a backup from SIT in just a few weeks.  We can't possibly go into this next phase with our DEV environment so out of sync with our release.  Especially with the overlap we are going to have.

Henry,



Report delivery is being done by Bhaskar and I am just helping him in getting access.

What I meant by not depending on SIT was because of slow response of database and the fact that 1st MSTR report failed because of time out error against SIT database. Bhaskar will check tomorrow if it is resolved.



We have passed SIT for 5 LOBs and by tomorrow it should be 7. Revised CLS data is being loaded in SIT and we will send a mail to Beth about that shortly.

Subject: MSTR Report



Henry,

We have started working on MSTR reports. We created report of 'Priniple balance distribution by Product'. We had put a filter in the report to ensure that report is created only for 2 months data (this was for testing).

However, we could not execute the report as the report failed because of timeout error.

I think we need to create aggregate tables (as you have said, MSTR is a god aggregate aware tool) to make sure report runs faster.

Also, enclosed specifications list table columns that we have identified for reporting. For now, the attributes and metrices that you have created seem good to start creating reports.

I see the second slide now.   When I opened it before, I thought I was just looking at the same deck again by the first slide.  

This is just what we needed.   Hopefully, we'll be able to work something out today. 

Where is CLS data in the development database right now for the big dimensions and fact?  Exactly what tables is CLS in? 

We absolutely need some aggregate tables.  What I would plan would be to build a 1st level aggregate that immediately rolls out the LOAN LEVEL information and goes to the snowflaked dimensions. 

This report is obviously several reports on the same screen with buttons to take you to a number of other reports.  I would suggest that the interface and navigation tuning come after we get the data and aggregates in place to support the base reports..

Hi Henry,



Apologies for stepping in late into this discussion. Following is the status as of today



Yogesh and I had mapped the reporting elements to the Gbank tables and attributes, and the same was forwarded to you by kishor (attached mail, second slide). For the trend line we could not find appropriate structures in the db and would need logical tables as described in the ppt.



Also, as we have been unable to execute the reports yet (time out errors- as reported by kishor on Friday, we are still getting the same), the reporting elements still need to be verified, i.e. if they have correct id and description forms set up.

We cannot verify the hierarchies defined in the dimensions until we get past the above mentioned step.



Since the Fact tables are pretty huge, kishor and I wanted to bounce the Aggregate tables idea with you, in terms of feasibility (increasing the timeout attribute for reports if not feasible).



Following is the list of all attributes for the aggregate table:



F_CRED_FCLT_MTH.PRIN_BAL_AMT grouped by the following



D_DATE.MTH_NM



D_DATE.YR_NM



D_COMPOSITION.COMP_DSC



D_SRC_STM.SRC_STM_CD



D_Collateral_Type.CLTRL_TP_DSC



D_Industry_Code.NAICS_CODE



D_Prod.Prod_CD



D_Purpose.Purp_DSC



D_ZIP_GEO.STATE_CD



D_COST_CENTER.CST_CNTR_NM



The above aggregate table should be able to cater to the needs of the list report and the pie chart on the dashboard and also cater to the drill across.



A Logical table summing Principal  balance on buckets of DYS_PST_DUE_CNT and RPT_PRD_DATE_ID from F_CRED_FCLT_MTH

            and

another Logical table summing Principal  balance on buckets of RISK_SCORE and RPT_PRD_DATE_ID from D_RISK_SCORE and F_CRED_FCLT_MTH for BEACON



would together cater to the trend line.



Please share your thoughts on the same.

And for the most important point - I need that list of tables and columns for those aggregates.



SIT database should be much faster that DEV at this point.  The hardware is faster and dedicated. 



I'm sure you realize that for the 5 LOBs that have now passed, it is only after they were moved back to development for defect repairs.



Keep in mind that DEV will need to be totally replaced by a backup from SIT in just a few weeks.  We can't possibly go into this next phase with our DEV environment so out of sync with our release.  Especially with the overlap we are going to have.

Henry,



Report delivery is being done by Bhaskar and I am just helping him in getting access.

What I meant by not depending on SIT was because of slow response of database and the fact that 1st MSTR report failed because of time out error against SIT database. Bhaskar will check tomorrow if it is resolved.



We have passed SIT for 5 LOBs and by tomorrow it should be 7. Revised CLS data is being loaded in SIT and we will send a mail to Beth about that shortly.

kishor,



Please reference my email from March 4th at 10:56 am.  We need a list of which dimensions you are planning to use and what levels / columns will appear on the reports and be drillable.    We can only create useful aggregates when we know the columns that will be needed.     Please respond to this email from last week and we can get some aggregations created. 



I am not aware that we have any remaining infrastructure issues?  I  believe everything has been resolved for a couple of weeks now.   Please list what you believe are remaining infrastructure issues. 



I am very concerned that you don't believe we can \"depend on SIT\" database.  We are trying to load history there for our production application.  We are many weeks late from the original timeline and this is not due to any infrastructure issues .If you don't believe we can depend on SIT now, then we are in serious trouble with our deliverable and I would suggest that you divert all of your attention from reporting and to making SIT successful.   We can find someone else to deliver reports.    To punctuate that point, six of the eight sources that have been sent to SIT have failed and had to be returned to DEV.  This is very poor quality. 

Concerning CLS, I believe we are still waiting on you guys to run the SAS extracts from the data with the repaired keys.  CLS can be next in line on SIT when you have the data ready. 



For DEV versus TEST environment, we know that DEV has a lot of TEMPORARY / WORK tables in place.  I suspect that if we have Stuart start repointing to different tables, we might get some undesired political results.  In any event we can switch back and forth on demand between the TEST and DEV environments. We just need to understand the columns and tables that will be used.   Please document what is being used in the reports and we can get some aggregates out there - either or both environments.

Hi Henry,



Did you get a chance to look into this?



Looking at response time on TEST box, I think we should adopt following method:

1. Create a set of credit facility tables in DEV box specifically for reporting.
2. Load only CLS data in those tables.
3. Connect to DEV tables from MSTR.


Let me know if this is possible. Looking at activities going on in SIT, I dont think we should depend on SIT database.



Sam, we are facing some infrastructural issues. Though we have created some basic reports, we are not able to execute them.



Thanks,

Subject: MSTR Report



Henry,

We have started working on MSTR reports. We created report of 'Priniple balance distribution by Product'. We had put a filter in the report to ensure that report is created only for 2 months data (this was for testing).

However, we could not execute the report as the report failed because of timeout error.

I think we need to create aggregate tables (as you have said, MSTR is a god aggregate aware tool) to make sure report runs faster.

Also, enclosed specifications list table columns that we have identified for reporting. For now, the attributes and metrices that you have created seem good to start creating reports.

On the reporting front I tried to create the reports again today and was successful just once to see the data for principal balance by product. After that I kept getting the time out message.

Thanks Bhaskar,



I see the second slide now.   When I opened it before, I thought I was just looking at the same deck again by the first slide.  



This is just what we needed.   Hopefully, we'll be able to work something out today. 



Where is CLS data in the development database right now for the big dimensions and fact?  Exactly what tables is CLS in? 



We absolutely need some aggregate tables.  What I would plan would be to build a 1st level aggregate that immediately rolls out the LOAN LEVEL information and goes to the snowflaked dimensions. 



This report is obviously several reports on the same screen with buttons to take you to a number of other reports.  I would suggest that the interface and navigation tuning come after we get the data and aggregates in place to support the base reports..

Hi Henry,



Apologies for stepping in late into this discussion. Following is the status as of today



Yogesh and I had mapped the reporting elements to the Gbank tables and attributes, and the same was forwarded to you by kishor (attached mail, second slide). For the trend line we could not find appropriate structures in the db and would need logical tables as described in the ppt.



Also, as we have been unable to execute the reports yet (time out errors- as reported by kishor on Friday, we are still getting the same), the reporting elements still need to be verified, i.e. if they have correct id and description forms set up.

We cannot verify the hierarchies defined in the dimensions until we get past the above mentioned step.



Since the Fact tables are pretty huge, kishor and I wanted to bounce the Aggregate tables idea with you, in terms of feasibility (increasing the timeout attribute for reports if not feasible).



Following is the list of all attributes for the aggregate table:



F_CRED_FCLT_MTH.PRIN_BAL_AMT grouped by the following



D_DATE.MTH_NM



D_DATE.YR_NM



D_COMPOSITION.COMP_DSC



D_SRC_STM.SRC_STM_CD



D_Collateral_Type.CLTRL_TP_DSC



D_Industry_Code.NAICS_CODE



D_Prod.Prod_CD



D_Purpose.Purp_DSC



D_ZIP_GEO.STATE_CD



D_COST_CENTER.CST_CNTR_NM



The above aggregate table should be able to cater to the needs of the list report and the pie chart on the dashboard and also cater to the drill across.



A Logical table summing Principal  balance on buckets of DYS_PST_DUE_CNT and RPT_PRD_DATE_ID from F_CRED_FCLT_MTH

            and

another Logical table summing Principal  balance on buckets of RISK_SCORE and RPT_PRD_DATE_ID from D_RISK_SCORE and F_CRED_FCLT_MTH for BEACON



would together cater to the trend line.



Please share your thoughts on the same.

And for the most important point - I need that list of tables and columns for those aggregates.



SIT database should be much faster that DEV at this point.  The hardware is faster and dedicated. 



I'm sure you realize that for the 5 LOBs that have now passed, it is only after they were moved back to development for defect repairs.



Keep in mind that DEV will need to be totally replaced by a backup from SIT in just a few weeks.  We can't possibly go into this next phase with our DEV environment so out of sync with our release.  Especially with the overlap we are going to have.

Henry,



Report delivery is being done by Bhaskar and I am just helping him in getting access.

What I meant by not depending on SIT was because of slow response of database and the fact that 1st MSTR report failed because of time out error against SIT database. Bhaskar will check tomorrow if it is resolved.



We have passed SIT for 5 LOBs and by tomorrow it should be 7. Revised CLS data is being loaded in SIT and we will send a mail to Beth about that shortly.

kishor,



Please reference my email from March 4th at 10:56 am.  We need a list of which dimensions you are planning to use and what levels / columns will appear on the reports and be drillable.    We can only create useful aggregates when we know the columns that will be needed.     Please respond to this email from last week and we can get some aggregations created. 



I am not aware that we have any remaining infrastructure issues?  I  believe everything has been resolved for a couple of weeks now.   Please list what you believe are remaining infrastructure issues. 



I am very concerned that you don't believe we can \"depend on SIT\" database.  We are trying to load history there for our production application.  We are many weeks late from the original timeline and this is not due to any infrastructure issues .If you don't believe we can depend on SIT now, then we are in serious trouble with our deliverable and I would suggest that you divert all of your attention from reporting and to making SIT successful.   We can find someone else to deliver reports.    To punctuate that point, six of the eight sources that have been sent to SIT have failed and had to be returned to DEV.  This is very poor quality. 

Concerning CLS, I believe we are still waiting on you guys to run the SAS extracts from the data with the repaired keys.  CLS can be next in line on SIT when you have the data ready. 



For DEV versus TEST environment, we know that DEV has a lot of TEMPORARY / WORK tables in place.  I suspect that if we have Stuart start repointing to different tables, we might get some undesired political results.  In any event we can switch back and forth on demand between the TEST and DEV environments. We just need to understand the columns and tables that will be used.   Please document what is being used in the reports and we can get some aggregates out there - either or both environments.

Hi Henry,



Did you get a chance to look into this?



Looking at response time on TEST box, I think we should adopt following method:

1. Create a set of credit facility tables in DEV box specifically for reporting.
2. Load only CLS data in those tables.
3. Connect to DEV tables from MSTR.


Let me know if this is possible. Looking at activities going on in SIT, I dont think we should depend on SIT database.



Sam, we are facing some infrastructural issues. Though we have created some basic reports, we are not able to execute them.



Thanks,

I'll have to talk to Stuart about the name cross reference.   He did that on his own.  I'll check into it. 

What you need to do now for development is to create your base table with a small subset of data.  This will immediately free you up to do any reports necessary and bolster your productivity.   Take the smallest amount of time (months) you need to support trend reports and then only take 1/1000 of the rows.   We need to show some progress, so do this ASAP.  if you need some guidelines on how to do this, Beth can provide some assistance.  But basically all you need to do is move the data with a mod(xxxx_id,1000) = 1 to grab a subset.   You'd want to grab this subset for the fact and cred faclt dimension.  I don't think we are using collateral and obligor dimensions so wouldn't worry about that now.

I guess I had already forwarded the email from Henry about these fields. To reiterate the decision about these fields

* These fields can not be calculated at MSTG ---> MRT layer as they require prior month fields and a Join to fact.
* We have deferred this to Ph1 e as its involves model change (all these fields will be added to D_CRED_FCLT), Mapping change.
* For now just follow whatever is in the mapping document - The logic is correct, only difference will be that it would in D_CRED_FCLT and will join fact to get prior month fields.
* Its a known defect and users are aware of it.
* I would suggest the testing team can defer it to the Ph1 e.
* Check with Anand / Partha/ Debtosh / Mugdha as there are certain scenarios (where prior fields are not required) for which it can be tested. If not then we can defer it .

This is regarding the WRK to STG mapping -

We have open few defects in UT on  PYMT_AMT, PYMT_DT & PYMT_STATUS_IND. But from development team I come to know that
there is some discussion going on these columns , these might be set to NULL in WRK to STG & then will be calculated in STG to MART layer

Is this correct? Please update the Mapping doc or send us the confirmation mail accordingly will change our queries & close the defect.

WRK_to_STG test case needs to be updated for Sold logic. This logic is currently not updated in the document. This applies to MLS, CLS, and RAC. Also the Jan 2009 data is not useful for this logic (verified for CLS). So we need to test for some other months data.



We are expecting confirmation on the same from development team as the document does not mention anything about the logic.



History SIT: MVS done. LFS data not loaded.



STG_to_MART: We are currently running test cases fro 5 LOBs. We are currently testing fact table.



Please let me know if you need more information.

According to the project plan, our promotion date for the SI process is on 3/30, which is a week from Monday.  Before we hand the code over, the following things need to happen:

1)  Finish Unit Testing
2) Test all Sessions and Workflows for correctness
3)  Move all our code to the mart_ccrm and shared_mart folder from the _dev folders
4) Run all workflows from beginning to end, using the unix scripts

I sucessfully exported the target shortcut- sc_to_WRK_MVS_MVCCDDA_CC_MAST_REC_PRIOR.
The other target shortcut sc_to_WRK_MVS_MVCODECP_FIS_PD_CD_PRIOR is failing as it actual table definition in the DEV_USM_SHARED folder does not exist.

The target table is not used in our development of WRK to STG mappings.

The XML for target shortcut- sc_to_WRK_MVS_MVCCDDA_CC_MAST_REC_PRIOR is also attached.

Senthil, Kenny,

We should be ready by the end of the  week to promote our HUB to WRK processes from dev to si.  These are already unit tested and won't be dependent on the rest of the process.  Promoting now will help us to break the promotion process into smaller chunks, and allow us to get a jump on the SIT process for these processes. 

I'm attaching the two promotion checklists.  Senthil, if you can give me an idea how long it would take you to promote this stuff, and when you could schedule it.  I'd prefer Friday or Monday.

Thanks,

Hey there -

Here is an example of the kind of UAT we're performing.  We've created an existing report (Balance by Account Status) out of LGRED and then recreated the same report from CCRMTST and are saving the results out to PDF.  The PDF file as well as the SAS program used to create the reports are attached.  This test was for Mortgage only and the results matched (Yippee!).  We're planning to run this report for all LOBs, as well as additional reports to test more dimensions.

Only data through Dec.2008 is currently loaded in CCRMTST.  Does this mean we'll have to run our UAT testing again once the current month's are loaded - to verify the HUB to mart load?


Thanks,
Melanie Burns

Hi Praveen -

I've been working on a couple, and Beth has been helping out with where to pull data from in the mart.  Should I be directing these questions to you instead?  I should have some results today to share with you.

Subject:        Balance By Account Status - Results

Hi all -

Attached are some results of reproducing the \"Balance by Account Status\" report for all LOBs from LGRED and CCRMTST.  The following spreadsheet contains all LOBs, except for SBB, COM, and SFW - I'm currently still running the report for these 3.

Good news - BMSC, CC, MLA, PRIME and DRL all look good.
Bad new - looks like we have discrepancies in BMSR, LEND, EQFIN, SHF (Did SHF and SFW get mixed up? Not seeing anything in SHF until Dec.2007 - which is when we started getting T2 SFW...), SFR and RAC.

The LOBs with discrepancies have red tabs in the following spreadsheet - and the the individual cell data that does not match is also displayed in red.

<<BalanceByAccountStatus.xls>>

Here is the SAS code that was used to produce the report (as well as the output in PDF):
<<BalanceByAccountStatus.sas>> <<BalanceByAccountStatus.pdf>>


Please let me know if you have any questions - or if there is anything else I need to do to help resolve.

Subject: Defcon-1

All,

Vacation is over.  We'll be driving in tomorrow.  6 out of 11 LOBs so far have faild Melanie's UAT testing.  Our quality so far has not been impressive.   Hopefully, it will be just a matter of helping Melanie to write queries, but I fear worse.  I think we all know what a complete reload of history means at this point.  

Adam,  

This is history, but is has implications.   Monthy is much more complex than history so we have more reason to be proactive. 

All,

We are all going to camp out there until this is done.  Weekend in W-S - hopefully not, two weekends in W-S hopefully not.  Late delivery - defintely not. 

Praveen,

When / if we get into another reload situation, we need the test team to drive it.   We can't afford $ to have Beth working two shifts to make this happen.   We'll give explicit instructions. 

Seema, Adam, 

We are probably going to need to invade the SIT testing time for a week to wrap up history.   But I suspect that when we get more proactive, we will find that we need it.  

All,

We need to get Melanie's code (after we have verified) and make plans to run that in some sort of test on DEV with the monthly.

EQFIN compararison between MRT and HST is fine. There is disconnect between the sas dataset and HST. We rejected some records in eqfin right?

<<eqfin_full_ds.xls>>
Select data_date,CURRENT_ACCOUNT_STATUS , count(*),sum(CURRENT_PRINCIPLE_BALANCE) from HST.EQFIN_FULL_DS
where (CURRENT_CHARGE_OFF_STATUS = 'N' and PAID_STATUS_CALC is null and CURRENT_PRINCIPLE_BALANCE > 0)

This query gives exactly same result as ($) as in MRT.

Hi kishor

For SHF - If the LOB_ID is fixed the dollars are matching.
For RAC - Looks like the bucketing is incorrect if we add the active and inactive account $ figures they tally.

Check the SHF and RAC tab in attached sheet. I am continuing analysis for other LOB's.

I've again corrected the NULL dates in CR_LEND.  I've talked to the analytics team and we're not sure why this keeps happening.  They're going to try and research (but everyone is extremely busy!) to see if they can identify the problem.  If it happens again next month - please let me know and I'll just keep running the code to correct the problem.

Hi Melanie

The CR_LEND file sitting on SAS server (created 3/4) again has the 87 records with NULL data dates.Looks like it a recurring issue. We need to fix this. For now we are fine on History as we have loaded the data from last extract which was corrected by you.

Hi Seema -

The NULL dates have been updated in CR_LEND.  I'm not sure how they were wiped out - but I don't think it should happen again going forward.  The monthly processing should only be adding current month's data and not be running through all of the extract files again.

Can you please correct these records in the cr_lend dataset?
We need to have the dataset and the table in sync.

We will extract the corrected combined dataset again and load history.

Is there a way to make sure that this does not get overwritten when the combined dataset is created again next month?

I will check if we have the earlier copy of combined dataset. But if you can correct them in attached sheet, we will correct them in the dataset loaded in DB2without extracting it again. Its just 87 records so should be manageable.

Hi Melanie

One quick question on cr_lend created on 2/20 :
 << Message: NULL Dates in Lendmark >>
There are 87 records with data date as NULL. Do we need o correct them as per the attached email you sent sometimes back or reject them in history?

 << File: LEND - REJECT_created 20th feb.xls >>

Thanks & Regards

Hi Melanie

We have JAN-2009 files in History missing for following LOB's

LFS - LENDMARK - I know you are working on this for Arrangement Id fix
DFP - SFW T2 - We dont have the JAN 2009 Train 2 file. However T1 is present which causes a disconnect.
EFS - EQFIN - Jan 2009 file is not created.

Let me know how do we process these 3 lob's for History and Jan 2009 data.

Thanks & Regards

This is because all the CLS  flags are populated from Train2 , which does not have flat to sas transformation.
SFW and RAC are taken from Train 2but why CLS was taken from Train 2

I checked if it can be corrected by an external update but there is a diff of 2 records (after subtracting 609 CF records) and a straight update wont work.

Henry,

Seema and off-shore team had done the research on the defects last night and here are a few pointers.

The UAT query that Melanie used missed a filter in the SQL. She confirmed that the LFS balance amounts are now matching after using the right filters.

Data set was changed in SAS after we loaded SFR, EFS and BMSR in SIT. Hence the difference in amounts for these LOBs. We classified TI records as inactive  for BMSR and RAC which was the reason the balances didn't match. If we add the active and inactive amounts it perfectly adds up to the balances in SAS data.

Please find attached the UAT defect status.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Seema - Please feel free to add anything that I might have missed.

Thanks,
Praveen

With the UAT results being different than our SIT/Unit testing results, we need to make some changes in our approach for our monthly test execution.  Even though we have test cases that validate each and every mapping, it would be a good idea to walk that extra mile by adding some business test scenarios.

We had a discussion with Melanie about the same today and decided that we should run similar SAS reports that Melanie is running now in UAT.  Melanie has agreed to work with us in defining these scenarios next week. I will send it to the whole group once we finalize the scenarios.

Since we will have a stable environment in SIT with less wiggling, we should be able to run these reports right from the day 1 of SIT.  We will make sure that SIT environment is sound and that we dont have a moving target. UAT will still be done by Melanie for the monthly processing but this time, with enough testing done on SIT, let us make sure there are no defects in UAT.

I haven't had a full chance to go over in more detail on this. But are you running this query from BDWDEV database? If so, why are you using the schema BDWDV? That schema is a federated schema that we had when BDWDEV used to be on CRMTST01 server, now that BDWDEV is on will-etldev02, you don't need to use that BDWDV schema just use the actual schema name..

For SIT pass 1 (first month load for all LOBs)
SIT environment:
1.  Testing team will execute UNIX scripts to run the jobs as they would be run in production (Adam will provide the UNIX scripts)

2.  Testing team will run test scripts after each or group of LOBs is loaded and will report any defects to Praveen
2a.  Melanie will run UAT reports after each or group of LOBs is loaded and provide Praveen with any defects
3.  Praveen, Adam, Seema, Beth and will be determined how defect needs to be corrected, in terms of if it is a coding error, mapping error, test script error, etc.

4.  Any defects requiring mapping document changes, Seema/Adam will make the correction in the mapping document and pass that to Praveen who will provide the updated mapping doc to the testing team and to Anand/kishor

Development environment:
5.  Defects just in code will be provided to Anand/kishor
6.  Anand/kishor will make sure defects/updated mapping documents are given to appropriate developer
7.  Developers make corrections and re-unit test in Development environment (Informatica DEV folders and development databases)

8.  After passing ALL unit tests, Anand/kishor/Testing team will tell Adam what code is ready to be re-migrated.
9.  Adam will move updated code to migration folders and request move of updated code to the SIT environment. - This will be done in batches and not by piece mail, all corrected defects for a SIT pass should be migrated together.

SIT environment:
10.  Infa Admin will move code
11.  Database tables are restored from previous backup
12.  Testers can restart the cycle from Step 1
13.  Once all SIT and UAT pass we will take a back up and restart this cycle for SIT pass 2 (second month load for all LOBs)

The ONLY people who can submit a request to having code migrated is Adam/Beth and that is for all levels of this process from HUB workflows to MRT workflows.

Praveen, please add to this if you see anything that is missing or out of order etc.  We can discuss the best ways to make this cycle as efficient as possible.

I found that there is a difference in record count. But could not recreate the scenario as my query results are not matching with Melanie's either LGRED or Mart counts. So we need query from her.

Hi kishor

The files created by Melanie and the result set are copied on the shared drive

Y:\Phase 1 - ETL Re-engineering\UAT RESULTS

Most of the Products look fine, still there are minor discrepancies which we need to figure out before sending the result to her.

MLA - Looks like there is some discrepancy in query. The no of records are different. I should get the query from her tomorrow.

SHF - Known issue with LOB_ID
LEND - Count mismatch - need to look into
BMSR , EQFIN - Known issue with Duplicate arrangement id.
SFR - Dataset change . Confirm if the count diff is due to it.
SBB - Confirm is the count diff is due to Train 1 Train 2.

Risk Status Results are also copied.You can start reconciling them. Else I will start tomorrow.

Here are the DPSR descriptions, but first it is useful to know where we are now. 

We have loaded the complete three years of data into CCRMTEST for all LOBs.  This data has passed SIT testing but we have a couple of UAT issues.   A good portion of the data will need to be reloaded very soon.  

In general, the reason for all of these backups is because of the clock time we will spend processing.   Loading and processing three years of data takes days.   A backup takes hours.  

History is loaded from SDS and with SQL.   Monthly is loaded from Hub and with INFA.   Completly independent processes and sources and they are tested independently. 


Again, I'll be more than happy to key these in and work with the DBAs directly.  


1) Backup #1 of CCRMTEST environment

    After the data has been reloaded with UAT fixes, we will want to take a backup of CCRMTEST.  We will want this toward the end of this week or slightly later.    

Label this backup as the \"HISTORY AFTER UAT\".  We need to keep this backup at least until we go into production. 
2) Backup #2 of CCRMTEST environment

    After SIT cycle 1 runs successfully and passes UAT, we will want to take anther backup. We will need this done after April 13th.  It is very hard to judge the exact date, because we don't know how testing is going to go and we don't know how the test environment is going to respond. 

Label this backup \"FIRST MONTH LOAD AFTER UAT\".    We need to keep this backup at least until we go into production.


3) Restore #1 CCRMTEST environment

    We may have defects for the first monthly run.   If we have defects, we will gather and document them all and assign to dev team for repair.   After problems have been investigated, we will want a recovery of \"HISTORY AFTER UAT\" backup into CCRMTEST to reset the database back to the starting point for monthly load.  

This could happen the week of April 6th or perhaps the next.     

4) Restore #2 CCRMTEST environment

   SIT cycle 2 involves some tests which alter the data to create certain conditions.  We then have SIT cycle 3 which involves running a second month.   Therefore, after SIT cycle 2, we need to recover the database back to the point before the destructive tests were run - after the first months load.   We will want a recovery of \"FIRST MONTH LOAD AFTER UAT\" backup into CCRMTEST to reset the database back to the starting point for second monthly load.   

April 13th or 20th week 

 5) Restore CCRMTEST environment (3)

     We may not need this one, but I wanted to get an extra one in the queue just in case we needed it.  

6) Redirected Restore of CCRMTEST environment to CCRMPROD environment

    Early in the week of April 6th.   This is the \"migrated\" data from SAS datasets which has been accepted by the user. 

7) Drop designated indexes in CCRMTEST environment

    Before we reload the three years of history into CCRMTEST, we need to drop most of the indexes on the mart tables.  Otherwise performance suffers badly.   We have the DML.   We can get Farah to do this before he leaves.

8) Add Designated index in CCRMTEST environment. 

    After we reload the three years of history data, we need to get the indexes added back to support the SIT and UAT testing.  Otherwise, testing will take much too long.   We have the DML.  This needs to happen between late this week and early next week.   Timing depends on how long the load takes which has been erratic.

Since we had no luck getting all 11 LOBs through the process together, we are changing gears.  We are going to do this again, running one LOB through the entire process at a time, tracking how long each one takes.  Let's start with MVS, since it's the largest.  Run each LOB from hub to wrk to mstg to UDA and finally through the mart, until we've done them all, truncating the mstg tables between each pass. 

Do this using the workflows in the mart_ccrm folder;  after this point there's no reason to use the dev_mart_ccrm anymore.  If there are any issues with using the mart_ccrm, we need to find them now and not later.  Also, use the unix scripts.

Yes, this means you will have to deal with the alphas and omegas.  Here is the simple trick:

This is from the etl_load_order_mrt_ccrm table:

WRK_LOAD,5
MSTG_LOAD,10
UDA_LOAD,20
MRT_DIM_LOAD,30
MRT_FCT_LOAD,40
MRT_DIM_UPD,50.

Note, these are in order of execution.  If you want to load the uda table, then the last thing run should have been the MSTG_LOAD. 

In the etl.etl_load_master_ops table, the curr_status_ind should equal 'C' and the Curr_load_type should equal 'MSTG_LOAD'.  Go ahead and set the curr_load_type to 'MSTG_LOAD' for all src_stm_cds and set curr_status_ind  = 'C'. 

Likewise, if I want to run the MRT_FCT_LOAD, the CURR_LOAD_TYPE should equal 'MRT_DIM_LOAD' with curr_status_ind = 'C', indicating that the mrt_dim_load step completed successfully.

Beth, do you have anything to add?

Seema,

CLS-
1. Do we need to load the TRNSFR_FROM_RPT_PRD_DT_ID for TI
2. What should be the TRNSFR_FROM_LOB_ID for Non TI? Is it '!!UNK' or '!!NA'

You have updated SBA_FLAG trandformation as NULL in Mapping docs for other LOB's.
Do we need to make changes in the History load scripts.

I was not at all nervous.

But yes I was not attentive for some time:). There was an email from Beth about cost center DEP logic (joining WRK GL table to get 7 digit cost center). And I was responding to her.

Mood is OK. Henry is full into Ph1e. Tomorrow we have a call with IT folks to discuss the project plan. He should be sending the draft plan to all of us soon.
if we can finish reloading the history soon it would be great.

You must be knowing the Monthly SIT date officially in the project plan is 3rd April so take time and do a though test Monthly.

Praveen / Seema -

I've coded/run a new report for UAT - \"Balance by Matrix_DPD\" - and have attached some results.  The ZIP file contains the results for RAC, PRIME, COM, SBB, and LEND - these results don't look like they match.  Can you take a look to see if you can determine why they're not reconciling?  The SAS code is also attached.

Major difference in DYS_PST_DUE -
Train 1 and Train 2 entirely has different DAYS_PST_DUE for the same arrangement_id. The scripts takes it from Train 2 ?

I hope thats the issue with SBB and COM DPD mismatch. If you see its matching after taking the DAYS_PST_DUE from Train 1. Change the script and send it to Beth.


Select DAYS_PAST_DUE, UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER, t2.DATA_DATE , t1.data_date, t1.ARRANGEMENT_ID,t1.CURRENT_DAYS_PAST_DUE

There are couple of changes/updates for SFR, COM/SBB and MVS.

1. SFR - Full dataset has been changed so we need to reload the FULL DS in Sit again.
   I have copied the new dataset file on SIT Box at below location.
   /crminstall/sfr_new.txt
   I have attached the script to load the sfr_full_ds below and same is available at location
   /crminstall/load_scripts/Load_SFR.sql
<<Load_SFR.sql>>

  Execute the above sql before starting the ILS load. You need to change the etlload password given in the above script.


Note: If you want to keep copy of existing SFR load then you can rename the existing sfr_full_ds table to another name.

2. CLS - DPD Matrix UAT issue. 
    Change - DYS_PST_DUE_CNT reference changed from train2 to Train1.
   Use the attached fact load script for CLS.
<<f_crd_fclt_cls.sql>>

3. MVS - I have sent you the updated WRK_ARR_MAX_DT table load script on Thursday. Same are attaached again.

Just let me know when you guys have finished and disconnected from db2. If everything passes, I will kick off the next systems which will be CLS, MVS, and ILS.  Can you verify that these systems passed all test in Dev for SIT/UAT fixes? 

MVS and ILS are the largest systems.  So my goal would be to let those run through today and possibly in tomorrow.  I will get as much loaded by Monday morning your time as I can.  Then you guys can pick up the testing from that point. 

I will send out an email letting everyone know when I have started loading on CCRMTEST.  No one should log on to that box until you see another email from me stating that I am finished loading. 

Thanks guys for all your efforts..

I think this will help.  Generally, everything in the SDS section are dependencies we have on tasks that SDS will design and implement.  This plan does not have detail for any SDS projects, only the dependencies I know that we have.   Doug; for example, has his own project plan for the hub enhancement and all I have in this plan are my known dependencies.   He in turn has some dependencies on me which impact his plan.   I assume that you guys will work together for any modeling changes related to the hub enhancement.      

Beyond that, I'm not expecting much if anything to be found in Mart gap analysis.   We already have a defined Train-2 mart model and you have already done a gap analysis on that with the BDW.   We are moving ILS and MLS up to Train-2 standards this release.   Unless there is something in those systems so different that they had to modify their definition of Train-2, we will not have anything additional in the Mart or the BDW Model.  

If something is found, I will be doing the gap analysis and modeling for Mart and I assume that you will be doing gap analysis and modeling for BDW / USM within SDS.  We should know if there is a gap very early next week and I'll let everyone know.   Before mid month we need to have our respective models and structures in place on the DEV  box. I asked Parag and Beth to assist you guys in phase 1 with your tasks on BDW / USM.   I don't have Parag anymore and with Beth's current workload in delivering phase 1 and rolling over to the extension, I can't allocate any significant time to this without affecting our time line.   Of course, she can answer any questions you might have.

The same thing holds true for any gaps we may find in the Hub sources.   I'm not sure how you guys deal with that modeling internally.   We will supply any gaps by early next week and all of the structures need to be in place before mid-April.   All of the dependencies are spelled out in the plan with dates since there are so many relationships between us this release.  

In a nutshell.   171D extension will be doing the mart modeling and SDS will be doing their core systems modeling (Hub, BDW, USM).

Henry,

I see the various task that look like might involve me, but I'm not sure which modeling tasks you are looking for me to support vs. those that Beth will handle.  When you get this finalized and have the actual resource names assigned, will you re-send the plan so that I can be sure to allow time where needed.

Thanks,

All, 

Here is the draft project plan.  Let me know if you have any input.   The dependency dates should be expected as we have discussed in several memos and meetings till now.  If we need to meet and review, please set up a meeting next week. 

Shauna,

We still have a bit more tweaking to do in terms of dependencies and some minor tasks.   But this is probably 90% there now.   I am still working on my local version though.  Perhaps we can target a review in Core Team meeting next Thursday and then put it on Sharepoint?

Melanie/Brad,

In the process of loading Sheffield data I realized that we had 60K more unique Obligors (Counterparties) than we do Arrangements.  When I went to look at the data is becomes obvious that from month the month the OBLGR (COUNTERPARTY_ID) do not come through the same even for what appears to be the same OBLGR.  For example 1 moth we have a number with no leading 0 and the next month we do have a leading 0 then the next month or a couple of months later it again comes through with no leading 0.  Unfortunately the leading 0 is not the only issue, some times the data comes through with the last 2 or 3 digits truncated.  And again this varies from month to month.  I don't believe there is anything we are going to be able to do about this at this juncture, but wanted to make you guys aware of it. 

Also since this is not a HUB table but a flat file feed.  We may want to verify that at least our feed for month will be consistent in the future.  We can discuss further if need be.

Below is a sample of what is going on (this just shows last digits truncated).. From this sample, it would appear that this seems to have happened a few specific months, but this is a very small sampling and would require more analysis to be sure.  There are a total of 447,943 (out of 6,604,126 total records) where the COUNTERPARTY_ID changes from month to month

We are done with the Balance by Account Status for SHF and RAC.



RAC: We think there is no issue with RAC. Please see the attached result excel sheet. We needed to apply some round/trunk functions in excel to make the value match. But the overall sum is matching exactly.



SHF: The results are not matching for few months. We are not having the exact SQLs which are used to calculate the MART results in the pdf sent by Seema. But we managed to write the SQL by which RAC results matched so the same queries should work out for SHF too.

Please check our SQLs first and then results for both of these LOBs. We think SHF has some issues.



Please let us know if the SQLs we have used are incorrect.



Thanks & Regards,

Mahesh

That is Maheshs id, we are using that to test the balance by account status. We need it for some more time.

Is it ok?

Ok..

I do see one id connected to db2: a70392.  So I need someone to close their connect to CCRMTEST...

I will get started as soon as that connection is gone.  If that is not someone on our team let me know..

Thanks, Parag..



Just let me know when you guys have finished and disconnected from db2. If everything passes, I will kick off the next systems which will be CLS, MVS, and ILS.  Can you verify that these systems passed all test in Dev for SIT/UAT fixes? 



MVS and ILS are the largest systems.  So my goal would be to let those run through today and possibly in tomorrow.  I will get as much loaded by Monday morning your time as I can.  Then you guys can pick up the testing from that point. 



I will send out an email letting everyone know when I have started loading on CCRMTEST.  No one should log on to that box until you see another email from me stating that I am finished loading. 



Thanks guys for all your efforts..

I need a status of UAT/SIT for RAC and SHF.  I did finish loading SFW, but I am not going to continue loading with out knowing if these other 2 systems have passed all testing.  Someone please give me a status update.  I will be on hold until someone lets me know the status.

Beth,

There are couple of changes/updates for SFR, COM/SBB and MVS.

1. SFR - Full dataset has been changed so we need to reload the FULL DS in Sit again.
   I have copied the new dataset file on SIT Box at below location.
   /crminstall/sfr_new.txt
   I have attached the script to load the sfr_full_ds below and same is available at location
   /crminstall/load_scripts/Load_SFR.sql
 << File: Load_SFR.sql >>

  Execute the above sql before starting the ILS load. You need to change the etlload password given in the above script.


Note: If you want to keep copy of existing SFR load then you can rename the existing sfr_full_ds table to another name.

2. CLS - DPD Matrix UAT issue. 
    Change - DYS_PST_DUE_CNT reference changed from train2 to Train1.
   Use the attached fact load script for CLS.
 << File: f_crd_fclt_cls.sql >>

3. MVS - I have sent you the updated WRK_ARR_MAX_DT table load script on Thursday. Same are attaached again.

Note: If you want to keep copy of existing SFR load then you can rename the existing sfr_full_ds table to another name.

2. CLS - DPD Matrix UAT issue. 
    Change - DYS_PST_DUE_CNT reference changed from train2 to Train1.
   Use the attached fact load script for CLS.

3. MVS - I have sent you the updated WRK_ARR_MAX_DT table load script on Thursday. Same are attaached again.

There should not be any change in the sfr and drl scripts.
sfr dataset was changed so new dataset has to be imported from text box.

I have made the Risk grade change as suggested by Seema for CF.
In case flags, we had taken them from train1 only wherever Train1 columns were available. So no change required for flags.

Seema - Please let me know in case I have missed n any flag.

Hi Beth

You would need the updated script.

Sunil - We have to change the following
* Status references to Train 1 - although it does not make any difference since all the statuses are 'U' for CF records
* Rsk Grd from Train 1 as these 609 records are not in Train2.

There are couple of changes/updates for SFR, COM/SBB and MVS.

3) I am 50% on BRD. Should complete it by EOD today.

Hi kishor,



The issue of Nulls has been sorted out , as I have made some changes in the SAS program.Now the file is not giving nulls as . .

 As below we can see that for amount field CURRENT_FACILITY AMOUNT, we are getting alphanumeric values ( I, E , {, G ) etc.

So because of this we are getting a loading issue as its a decimal in target.  I will do some data analysis on this tomorrow as its only for a particular month or whole data is like this.

Hi kishor

Attached is the Train 2 extract code for ILS (Ph1 e).
Please revise the sas engineering document if any changes from the code last used.

We will discuss about the following in today's call

* GLADSTONE - Gap analysis - Add a column in the reverse engg document and say - Need to update BRD / NOT / GAP.
* SDS and SAS Inventory gap analysis.
* I guess Mugdha was waiting on me for some MLS file/Copybook/HUB mapdoc?? I dont remember exactly. I will get that from her in the call.
* Flow diagram that you talked about last week.
Thanks & Regards

Henry -

We can provide you with a copy of the ILS extract code now if you would like - but there is going to be a minor change to the DAYS_PAST_DUE calculation (see below).  Let me know if you would like a copy of the code now - or would prefer to wait until the update is complete.  The change is very  minor and I think you could handle/implement without having to review the SAS code.

Tanee -

Can you update the DAYS_PAST_DUE logic to zero out DAYS_PAST_DUE when equal to the month-end date?  After the logic is run for DAYS_PAST_DUE you could simply check to see if DAYS_PAST_DUE is equal to the current month-end date - and if it is then set it to 0.  Can you let me know how long this will take - we need to load history ASAP to begin the next phase of our project (which started last week).


Also - when can we expect the MLA history to be loaded?

William;

Any time is fine with me.  I can kick off at  6:00 P.M today. Do I need a green light from you at 6:00 pm ?

I was just going what the DPSR said:

\"This timing is not exact. It will depend on the time required for reload and how long the SIT / UAT testing takes. We will need to coordinate the timing as the date gets closer and we know what the run times are like. \"

Farah,

A DPSR has been in the system to perform a backup at 9 am this morning.   Was this done?  

If not, we do need it; however, we now have people testing on the system and need to coordinate.   If you did not do this backup at 9 am, can you schedule it for 6 pm tonight.

I've requested 6 pm so that we can finish our testing today and then try to get the backup done before India shift comes in.   If any concerns, please respond to this chain so that we can coordinate.

Check the modified documents for MLS and ILS on shared drive.
SAS Inventory has all the fields mapped. There was a filter on one of the column so fields were not visible. I have mapped the MRT fields from SAS Inventory.

Please review both the documents thoroughly and send me the updated ones if there is any change.
These will be presented to Peggy tomorrow, so that she can clarify the identified gaps.

Next steps on Reverse engineering:
* Complete and document the Gladstone GAP.
* Compare derivation logic of common attributes ( base 30 elements which gets derived into 120 thru flat to sas) between Train 1 and Train 2. This can be done using the BRD. Melanie indicated that there have been changes in the logic in Train 2 SAS code and which will override the Train 1 logic. We have to get it documented and present it to her so that she confirms the correct logic.
* From the reverse engineering document - check the history data in the fields which are mapped to MRT (Logical only). If its NULL throughout the history we may not convert them into physical. Attributes  which have good data will dictate model change.Once the list is ready, we will review it with Beth.
* Start profiling.
Thanks & Regards

Hi Seema,



Please find the flow diagrams for ILS and MLS and the reverse engineering documents at \\punnfil02\GoldBank ccrm$\Phase 1E\Train 2 and also at

G:\Shared Data Services\Projects\Q171D - CCRM Data Mart\Phase 1 - ETL Re-engineering\Phase 1 e.



We did the HUB gap analysis and highlighted the row in yellow or left it blank where ever we could not find the HUB element.



SAS Inventory6 was not having many fields mapped. Hence we also referred the History mapping document. Please find the comments.



Changed the ILS and MLS mapping as per the new codes and added the filter criteria.

Also started work on Gladstone document.



Thanks & Regards,

Both TRAIN2 ILS , MLS are success fully loaded into FULL_DS Tables.



Most of the issues were regarding the date fields having character data type in source datasets, so I have changed them by using CATX, SUBSTR functions.



ILS issues:



Those are having values of Character NULL and 0 s. So I applied INPUT to covert them to numeric.



FACILITY_GRADE_DATE_1=INPUT(FACILITY_GRADE_DATE_1,10.);

CURE_DATE_1=INPUT(CURE_DATE,10.);

DIRECT_COLLECTION_COSTS_DTE_1=INPUT(DIRECT_COLLECTION_COSTS_DTE,10.);

COLLECTION_SYS_EFFECTIVE_DATE_1=INPUT(COLLECTION_SYS_EFFECTIVE_DATE,10.);

COLLECTION_SYS_FINAL_DATE_1=INPUT(COLLECTION_SYS_FINAL_DATE,10.);



CUURRENT FACILITY AMOUNT has some character values and having the format Z12.2 .



So I changed it to numeric 32.



format CURRENT_FACILITY_AMOUNT 32.;



MLS Issues:



ORIGINATION_DATE,

ORIGINAL_RISK_GRADE_DATE,

ORIGINAL_COLLATERAL_VAL_DTE,

LAST_REVIEW_DATE,

CHARGE_OFF_DATE,

RECOVERY_AMOUNT_DATE,

COLLECTION_SYS_EFFECTIVE_DATE,

COLLECTION_SYS_FINAL_DATE,

DIRECT_COLLECTION_COSTS_DTE



The above fields are in some different format of character data type.

So I applied SUBSTR, CATX





if left(origination_date_1)='0000' then origination_date_1=' ';

if left(ORIGINAL_COLLATERAL_VAL_DTE_1)='0000' then ORIGINAL_COLLATERAL_VAL_DTE_1=' ';

if left(LAST_REVIEW_DATE_1)='0000' then LAST_REVIEW_DATE_1=' ';

if left(ORIGINAL_RISK_GRADE_DATE_1)='0000' then ORIGINAL_RISK_GRADE_DATE_1=' ';

The history would be created be for ILS and MLS with new code.
Although the archive folder datasets can be referred for initial profiling for 'LOGICAL ONLY' mrt fields.

<<History>>
Again Beth has started going through various schemas on DEV and bringing out issues : To list a few

* Train 2 table created for MLS and ILS in X_TRAIN2 have the numeric fields defined as 'BIGINT' which is incorrect. Can you check the DDL's which created these tables?
* Why there are views created in HST schema?
* And many more to come.Today she is in 'FAULT FINDING MOOD' and blame:)
You should get another email from Henry on profiling.Looks like Beth is going to own and do the complete profiling exercise!

Can you please check with Melanie location and file name for combined Train 2 file for ILS & MLS?

Is it in \"<file://\\wil-sasprd02\BaseCreditRisk\CCRM>\\wil-sasprd02\BaseCreditRisk\CCRM BI\Staging\ILS\Archive\" directory with file name \"q310_ils_file\"? 
Files in \"Staging\" directory have monthly data. Aalso, the programs that we are analyzing create monthly files.

William;

Any time is fine with me.  I can kick off at  6:00 P.M today. Do I need a green light from you at 6:00 pm ?

I was just going what the DPSR said:

\"This timing is not exact. It will depend on the time required for reload and how long the SIT / UAT testing takes. We will need to coordinate the timing as the date gets closer and we know what the run times are like. \"

Farah,

A DPSR has been in the system to perform a backup at 9 am this morning.   Was this done?  

If not, we do need it; however, we now have people testing on the system and need to coordinate.   If you did not do this backup at 9 am, can you schedule it for 6 pm tonight.  


All,

I've requested 6 pm so that we can finish our testing today and then try to get the backup done before India shift comes in.   If any concerns, please respond to this chain so that we can coordinate.

Henry,

I don't think I am questioning testing approach at all. I am perfectly with you that we need to run scripts end to end and test the LOB and move to next.
But only thing I am suggesting is we have a separate copy of MSTG Credit facility tables so that we can use it for analyzing data once MSTG is truncated. This will be used only for analysis and not for any other purpose. None of the Informatica jobs will access it, none of the test scripts will access it. Only in case we have defects and we need to look back at data, we will use this table which has all MSTG data.

Testing team needs to do this analysis on failed test cases and we can not wait to do this analysis and then run next LOB.

I hope it is clear that I am in line with testing end to end one LOB at a time on production like schema and not anything else.

I would like to have a detail call with all the offshore BA's for the mapdoc updation.

Just want to ensure that I am on the right track regarding the take a way's from yesterday's Q171D Extension Review meeting:

* Need to determine when the MLS missing fields can be added to the HUB and provide you with a date.
* Review MLS Train 2 SAS Re-engineering document to determine which 'mappings' are enterprise ready by 4/20
* Review ILS Train 2 SAS Re-engineering document to determine which 'mappings' are enterprise ready by 4/20
* Review SAS Inventory Gaps, modify USM and/or BDW Model for gaps by 4/15 (Jim has some concerns regarding this date and will get back with you on this)
* We are waiting on a determination from the LOB on whether or not the CLS pointer file needs to be added to the HUB
* The GL COA Hierarchy file(s) will be loaded directly to the MART
* HUB re-work is progressing
Please let me know if I have miss stated and/or omitted anything.

Thanks!

Hey,

After I looked at the gap analysis I see that it was there.   I wrote the email based on what I had heard in our discussions.   I had never heard \"RADAR\" mentioned before or that we had a complete file missing.  So I jumped the gun based on meeting discussions.   I apologize. 

I am not interested in blame anywhere.   I am interested in improving everywhere.     

It does sound like you have some concerns.  I will schedule a meeting for us on Tuesday to let you vent these.

I dont think anything has missed in HUB analysis.
These columns even we had doubt so asked Peggy to confirm it as this information was not clear even in HUB mapdocs that she has put on shared drive.

Still if you say it was a miss on gap analysis, We will double check this.

Seema,

It seems our gap analysis has missed some things?   Please investigate why our gap analysis missed a complete input file and apparently a few columns to boot.   Does off shore need to take a second pass at this.  

Who did the reverse engineering for MLS?   It appears that they need a bit of coaching.

Thank you!

I have a concern/question regarding the following field:

RADAR   RADAR_ARM_PLAN_ID      

I believe this field is coming from the RADAR application (Funds Management) based on the information located in the SAS program (i.e. they list the  D540.FM.RADAR.MLS as the source for this field not the MLS system..). If so, is this in scope (we do not currently load data from RADAR in to the HUB).

I did looked through the MLS copybooks and found a field on the MLS ARM History File (RMSP184A) named: ARM-PLAN-ID. Is this the same field? If so, we already load this field in to the HUB as follows:

MLS_RMS184_ARMHISTORY_PUB       ARM_PLAN_ID    

Please let me know if this field will do or if we need to pursue getting data from RADAR?

I am also having difficulty finding a potential MLS 'source' for the following field:

UTILITY SUB_TYPE_SEQ_NO

There are multiple 'Utility' files for MLS  (294, 13EF, 13EG, 164H, 164I). If I can get a copy of the SAS code I may be able to narrow down where this field is coming from.

Please forward me a copy of the SAS code for MLS Train 2 and/or let me know where to get it from the G:/drive.

Thanks!

Good Morning!

The attached spreadsheet has the fields from your original Reverse Engg mapping_MLS_T2.xls spreadsheet that have been identified as 'not in the HUB'  (tab 1) and/or 'Need Confirmation' (tab 2).

Please confirm that these are the only fields that need to be added to the HUB and/or that you have questions regarding the mapping.

Once I have your response I will be able to contact the MLS folks to determine a delivery date to have the additional fields added to the MLS/HUB files.

Thanks!

Peggy,

This is the result of reverse engineering SAS code for ILS and MLS which are in scope for the extension  We have a little more fine tuning for our purposes, but I believe that there is enough information in there for you concerning the source columns targets and transformations where you can make the enterprise readiness determination.   Give us a yell if questions.

This gives the flow from HUB ----> SAS Code ----> LGRED dataset ----> MRT.
We have taken the SAS fields from Q310 files and mapped them backwards (HUB) and forwards (MRT - SAS Inventory).
I have highlighted the rows where there is a question on HUB table / column and needs confirmation. Similarly on MRT side the fields are mapped to SAS Inventory (Current as Logical Only fields).

At the end of the document the selection criteria is given

Supporting documents like flow diagram , DDL etc are kept on shared drive.

For future reference: 

For mappings designated as 'bulk'  ---
        if the target object in informatica differs in order of fields from the actual database table it represents, it makes the mapping fail. 

        So if we create all our target objects against x_mart_ccrm, and then have the dba create mart_ccrm, and he decides to switch out src_stm_cd and loan_tp_cd, the first time it tries to load that table it will fail.  At least, that looks like the explanation to me.   This was an issue with the f_cred_fctl_orphan_to_udd load, but only for EFS.  We are switching to a different src_stm while I research this issue.

We have found 4 defects for CLS. Please find attached the defect log spreadsheet. Offshore team has analyzed these defects and should be able to fix these now. We are now loading MVS. I think we should be able to speed up the SIT process now, given that our IDs are fixed and we are able to move forward.

Also, once we are done with MVS we will run the smaller LOBs, like EFS, DFP, after the bulk load issue is fixed.

All,

It appears we have issues with CLS.   I would suggest that we not need to wait until we get through to publish the results.   Please let Adam see these results real time.   He can then understand what modules might be impacted and get it organized for what needs to be looked at.  Meanwhile, the offshore team should be working to recreate the problem in dev so that they can debug.  

Also remember that we are going to go through all LOBs with testing.   We will not move in the fixes until the first wave of testing with all lobs is complete.  

So far, we are at about 24 hours for the first LOB.   At that rate?????

Hi Alll,

After analysis I found out that these fields were defined as decimal(9,0). This is the reason these fields were getting truncated. I have modified these and ran it once in dev_mart_ccrm folder.

Adam, Let us know how you plan to migrate this.

Laxman, Can you send me other amount related queries to check if this change modified other fields. Pass on the Prin_Bal_amt and prior_prin_bal_amt test queries.

Please find the updated defect log attached. D_OBLGR of RAC needs to be retested. There are some discrepancies found during its testing. The number of records getting updated in the target (MRT_OBLGER) is more than actual present in the source (MSTG_OBLGR) table.



Adam can start PRT preferably or DEP/SHF. Lets keep LFS/MLS/ILS/DFP on week days.

Hi Anand/Praveen



Just FYI.



For EFS we still have the common discrepancies we found in the development ie. CHNL_SRC_CD, NOTE_LINE_NBR and OBLGR_STATE_CD. I have not logged them as defect here as these fields are having less size in the target table so they are getting truncated.

Hi Praveen



Please find the updated defect log. We are done with EFS analysis except the same collateral queries.



Anand>> I will close the TRSNFR_FROM_LOB_ID defect after confirmation.

Also there 4 common defects in WRK-STG and STG-MRT. I have logged them on both sheets so that while verifying it you can verify the complete flow of the field. Most probably these defects will get closed in WRK-to-STG level.

Hi Praveen



Today we worked on MVS testing. Attached is the updated defect log. There are 3 defects in WRK-to-STG, if fixed they will probably fix the 3 defects in the STG-to-MART. Apart from that we logged few more defects.



I have asked Adam to load EFS. Will run the EFS test cases once it is loaded.



Please let me know if more information needed.



Thanks & Regards,
Mahesh

Subject:        Data profiling for phase 1E

Beth, Seema,

We have developed scripts for extracting train 2 data from SAS and loading into DB2 tables. Can you please let us know which schema should be used for loading the data?

During initial data profiling, we are planning to do following analysis-:

Profiling for entire dataset:

1. Counts
        a. Comparison of total count of records in train 1 and train 2
        b. Monthly comparison of train 1 v/s train 2 arrrangement IDs. Verify the arrangement IDs are same
        c. Check if there are any arrangement IDs that are present in a particular month in train 1 and in earlier / next month in train 2. We had this case in CLS.

2. Data descripancies
        a. Check for duplicate records
        b. Check if there are any records with NULL data date / arrangement id
        c. If a column is present in Train 1 and Train 2, a comparison of what % of rows have same value in train 1 and train 2 and if therre is any mismatch between train 1 and train 2.

Profiling for individual columns:

For numeric columns

1. Check minimum and maximum values.
2. Check number of records having 0 and null
3. Check if there is any month having all records as 0 or null
4. Check for negative values if any

For character columns

1. Check maximum length.
2. For non free text columns (e.g. product), check frequency of distinct values. Check if frequency is similar in all months

3. Check number of records having spaces
4. For values which occupy maximum length check if there is truncation of value.

For date columns

1. Check minimum and maximum dates.
2. Check number of records having default dates.
3. Check if there is any month having only 1 distinct date value (signifying that for that month hardcoding has been done)

After applying these checks, we can proceed to additional profiling depending on any descripancies found.

Please let us know if you recommend any other type of profiling in initial round.

Thanks,

kishor Deshpande

You can load the complete dataset now for ILS into History.   Dump what is there now and reload tonight please. 

We'll let you know about MLS / MLA.  

The profiling you have planned in TEAM India is useful.   We do have much more we want to run here at TEAM USA.  We may need to plan our runs so that we don't have too much contention.   We will see.

Hi Farah,

We are getting the following error while loading data in the table d_hst.ILS_TRAIN2_FULL_DS on DEV box.

SQL3508N  Error in accessing a file or path of type \"TEMP_FILE\" during load or
load query.  Reason code: \"6\".  Path:

We tried executing the script 2-3 times and got the same error. The file size is not large as we are trying to load it for one month only.

Can you please look into this?

It ran for 8 or so hours, we killed it and called Farah.  We ran statistics, he cleared the box, we ran it again, it ran for 12 hours before killing it again.  We rebuilt the session, repromoted it, reran it, and it ran for 14 hours before we killed it again.  We ran the job pretty much continuously, with new statistics, reworking the query, recreating the session, until we determined the source of the problem was the partitioning on the db, which happened around 7 am on 4/17.  During this time, we were unable to load anything else in SIT - we needed the tables for MLS, which was our last LOB for SIT round 1.

After we determined the issue was with the partitioned tables, we had to create new tables on the ccrm box, test the SQL, and then change and promote our sessions to point to the new ones.

We lost about 2 days of run time on the box, and had another half-day of a developer's time to implement, test, and promote the changes.

Subject:        Delays last week


We've had a number of issues over the past week, 

VDI became unavailable and the fix was chWhiteging to our tech support due to uniqueness of our link.  Couple of days lost.

MLS simply did not work in TEST for a specific query.   It worked fine in DEV.   Farah spend days trying to tune the query and days trying a work around.  For us, we have had to leave MLS behind in SIT 1 and SIT 2 and will come back in the end and run MLS separately and alone through its own unique SIT testing.  This is probably going to cost about a week of time with the workaround included.

Farah was unavailable for a shift and offhore was offline. 

With all this, the 29th is starting to be a chWhitege.  I will need to call for significant overtime to make this happen.   Keep in mind that 7 by 24 that we have been working does not mean that everyone is working 24 hour days.  It means that the staff is split into shifts where we are always running something.   We'll have to crank some OT now in addition to 7 by 24.   

I need to bill for this OT also.   If you consider our team of six offshore and they all worked 50% overtime for the next week, then the additional overtime would be less then $5000 so it is not very significant.

It would appear the table is in a load pending state, which no one has mentioned in all the times I have asked why you cannot load the correct table.  You should have the rights to get the table out of a load pending state.  In case you do not know the syntax for getting a table out of a load pending state it is as follows:

Subject: Ph2 - Onsite BA

Hi kishor

Today Henry spoke about my replacement for Phase 2 and as per him ,
obviously one of the offshore BA's who is in 1e is one of the potential
candidates...
But we had spoke about Sunil Pathak also...based on his BBnT business
knowledge and excellent technical skills....

What's your opinion? I would vote for Sunil, unless Atul / Sandesh
develop a very good understanding of Ph2 when it starts...

What about Debtosh? I guess he could be the additional coordinator
here...Ph2 definitely will have more than 1 onsite requiremnets..right?

Thanks & Regards
Seema

Also why are we putting our stuff in the ebdw file directory?  What we are doing has nothing to do with the ebdw and they do occasionally have some development going on.  The only stuff we should have in the ebdw directory is infa logs dealing with the WRK table loads and that is because we do share the WRK tables process. The SAS loads have nothing to do with the WRK tables and should be under the mart_dev directory structure.

All,

With our upcoming chWhiteges, concurrent development and increased data
sizes, the issue below is going to become more critical.   Before we
begin development on the extension, we are going to rebuild dev and
establish many new processes around its usage.   We are also going to be
trying several methods to get around our concurrency issues.    All of
this will be centrally managed.   ETLLOAD password will change and will
no longer be shared.  Things that hurt us in the relatively simple phase
1 will kill us in the much more complex phase 2.   Documentation on
these new standards and processes is coming soon.

We just got through the core team meeting.  We had all of the issues of

However, Adam stated that we were still on track to deliver on the 29th.

We do have one potential fallback if we loose time this weekend.  


MLS has now got to go through its own sit testing at the end and after a
recovery.  That has got to take a day or two all on its own.   If we
loose time this weekend, we can put the MLS INFORMATICA move off a week.
i.e.

we promote and freeze all applications on April 29th During the freeze
we finish SIT and UAT on MLS We promote and freeze MLS and May 8th We
begin running everything in production except MLS on May 8th
On May 15th, MLS will be ready to run in production.   

Let me know if questions.

So you are on the hook.   



We do have one potential fallback if we loose time this weekend.  


MLS has now got to go through its own sit testing at the end and after a
recovery.  That has got to take a day or two all on its own.   If we
loose time this weekend, we can put the MLS INFORMATICA move off a week.
i.e.

we promote and freeze all applications on April 29th During the freeze
we finish SIT and UAT on MLS We promote and freeze MLS and May 8th We
begin running everything in production except MLS on May 8th
On May 15th, MLS will be ready to run in production.   

Let me know if questions.

Review comments on WRK -->STG ILS
* Infa logic for few fields are missing. I am assuming that you will put it later.Highlighted the cells.
* Business definition of new fields added in MRT were missing. I added the definition and transformation for PYMT_TP_CD (which is applicable to ILS only) those. Make sure its replicated in other mapdocs as well.
* Change the mapping document directory path on 'Object Inventory' tab.
* We are not using the FEE and DLR tables. The corresponding fields are present in LOAN1 table.
* Most probably we wont source anything from YIELD table as well. Since its a part of DRL effort in Phase 2. For now I have marked them as Phase2.
* Once the tables are created in D_<> schema , verify the column count from the tables. This is the result on 'Object Inventory' tab.

* Plan for me from offshore - I am not very sure on this as Henry said he is talking to Sam about it and will let me know before I leave in next 3 weeks time:)
* I gave her the feedback about Praveen but looks like he is going to stay in Ph2 as Test coordinator as well as Onsite project manager. Henry does not want to let him go ---he will talk to Sam about it if forced....he says IT wants him in the team…Lucky guy…Henry spread the word that project is saved in terms of quality by Praveen….(that’s ridiculous)
* Adam will be replaced by someone travelling onsite.There would be no replacement for me here. Deena wants me to continue coordinating with Client even from offshore …So in short there will be just one person travelling here (most probably Sunil P) and IFF at all Praveen goes (that’s highly impossible) …one more (Mahesh K) …
* Beth will be more involved into coordination with offshore along with ONC who will be travelling here.
* She is still of the opinion …if YOU can travel and be here for Ph2…that would be the BEST option.
* Also asked me if I would like to reconsider my decision and stay here lil longer - for which I said…I have to go back now but can come later for short term if required…..
Its very clear that Henry is still not very comfortable with offshore and would like to keep most of the control onsite….

Whoever is travelling here ….has a BIG chWhitege in front of him / her…..

Subject: Phase 1E Process

Here is the high level process for Phase 1E, which is needs to be followed

Environment



DB2

1.   Everyone needs to be logging into the database as themselves with their network ids.  No one should be logging in as ETLLOAD except informatica.  When we move to the new CCRMDEV environment, as of now only Beth and Henry will know the ETLLOAD password.  If you have any issues logging on as yourself we need to know that so we can make sure to get your ids on the Unix system.

2.   No one is creating additional tables in the development or migration schemas other than Beth or Henry.  Should there be an immediate need for an additional table to be created then it should be done in your personal schema.  This should be purely a temporary solution and only subsets of data should be loaded into these tables, as to not waste space for the true schemas.   Data should be loaded for testing and then immediately dropped.  NO test scripts will be written or executed against a personal schema tables to be considered Unit Tested.

3.   The \"Real\" schemas are considered our migration schemas and will remain looking exactly as production tables until we are prepared from migration from the D_<schemas>.  We will be doing development in schemas prefixed with D_.  There will be no X_ schemas this go around.  If additional tables are created in random schemas, in the D_ schemas or the migration schemas, they are subject to be immediately dropped without warning.  If tables is personal schemas, take up necessary space for real development process, the data will be truncated, but warning will be provided.  

4.   Issues with the DB2 environment need to be sent to me and Henry and not the DBAs.  We will not have a \"DBA\" assigned to us in the next phase and will not have anyone available India time.  We will need to make sure any DB2 issues are carefully documented especially when they cause potential delays in the project.  Henry and I will filter and send to the DBAs the issues we encounter.  You should have rights to get a table out of a load pending state.  Anything dealing with space we need to discuss before making request to DBA.  Unfortunately we don't have the right to kill a session if necessary as of right now.



Informatica

1.   No one is to create or re-import Informatica Source or Target Definitions in the Development or migration folders.  Again this is a GoldBank policy.  This should only be handled by Adam or Beth.  And since there should be NO ddl created/changed to tables off site, there should be no reason for anyone offsite to import/create a Source or Target definition.  If you need to test something against a table in your personal schema and the ddl is different than the real schemas, then you can create/import Source/Target definitions in your personal development folder and work on your mapping there.   Any Source/Target definitions created by anyone else in these folders will be deleted without warning.

2.   No one should be creating real workflows.  For unit testing purposes everyone should create their own personal workflow named z_<developer name>.  Any unit testing or other testing should be done from these workflows.  At this time, Adam or Beth will compile the real workflows for migration.   Additional workflows created, not by Adam/Beth that are not personal workflows are subject to being deleted without warning.   

3.   Any issues with the Informatica environment need to be forwarded to Adam and Beth.



General Process

1.   BAs, Developers, and Testers will be assigned mappings and this will be tracked by onshore group as well as offshore.  There will be due dates assigned at the mapping level and each person will be accountable for getting their assigned task done on time.

2.   The mapping documents dictate every aspect of the Informatica mapping.  These are full blown development specs and include every object that should exist in the Informatica mapping and instruction.  That is not to say that during the course of development that we won't discover something wrong on missing with the mapping document. That should be communicated back to BA (Seema), the issue will then be researched, discussed with the client as needed and the mapping document will be revised to reflect necessary logic/objects changes.  The updated mapping document will be provided to the development team and ONLY then should the Informatica logic be revised.  Cases where the mapping document adds unnecessary variables or logic due to translation from SAS to Informatica, need to be provided back to the BAs so if can be verified and the mapping document can be updated to reflect that.

3.  The test scripts are written from the mapping documents and not from the Infa code.  If your logic doesn't match the mapping document, it will potentially fail unit testing.

4.  If your Informatica mapping doesn't match the mapping document it will fail Code Review.  This does not mean that every syntax in the Mapping document transformation will be exact to the Informatica syntax, what has to match is the overall logic, table joins, and the objects.  For example in mapping document if it states IF xxx THEN yyy ELSE zzz logic, and INFORMATICA syntax is IIF(xxx,yyy,zzz) that is a match.  Mappings that don't pass code reviews will not be migrated.   Side Note: for development and mapping docs, for any IF or DECODE logic there must be an ELSE or default provided if something doesn't meet previously listed requirements.

Beth,

We tried loading the ILS_TRAIN2_FULL_DS table in D_HST schema but it
failed. The space required to load ILS data is close to 50GB whereas the
free space available in the Tablespace TBLSP_HSTDS_DATA1 is less

Tablespace ID                        = 7
 Name                                 = TBLSP_HSTDS_DATA1
 Type                                 = Database managed space
 Contents                             = All permanent data. Large table
space.
 State                                = 0x0000
   Detailed explanation:
     Normal
 Total pages                           = 13778816
 Useable pages                      = 13778688
 Used pages                          = 13742784
 Free pages                           = 35904
 High water mark (pages)        = 13745888
 Page size (bytes)                  = 16384

Free space available is (16384 * 35904)/(1024*1024*1000)=0.561GB

We loaded the ILS_TRAIN2_FULL_DS in X_MRT_CCRM schema as space was
available in tablespace TBLSP_CCRM_DATA1.

Please do not drop this table as it is having the entire data for 3
years.

We will copy this data in the D_HST.ILS_TRAIN2_FULL_DS once we have
enough space in TBLSP_HSTDS_DATA1 and then drop the
X_MRT_CCRM.ILS_TRAIN2_FULL_DS table.

Thanks & Regards,
Mugdha Kale

Just so you know, all the 2008 accomplishments listed in slide 4 have been put together by Steve Kerrs group (Steve is a peer to Susan). Susans group apparently has not delivered on anything in 08 (according to Henry). Henry also mentioned that Steve Kerrs group has kind of been moving forward on its own accord & delivering on ad-hoc work that the business may or may not have necessarily asked forthe one exception probably is the Microstrategy reporting piece (if you look at the graphs on slides 11 & 12  though there is a comment that Microstrategy metrics are on hold).



Also, one thing of interest that I found was the mention of BICC as a focus area for 2009 on slide 13.



I will forward some other documents that Henry has put together outlining his thoughts around the future direction for the architecture piece as well as answering questions that Susan posed in the mail trail below.

Henry,

Here is a Dec that Mike used to present to Paul Johnson last month.  There are some notes included in this that I am responsible for providing information for.  This is what Mike wants me to provide for a second meeting with Paul.  Key questions are:

Why we did a large data warehouse?
Evolution?
What are the principles behind it?
Key tenets?
Why we established the warehouse?

My other questions:

Do we continue with thought of putting the credit risk data in the WH?
Do we just focus on truly enterprise data? Interested Party (customer), employee, GL
Do we focus on more data that could support operational reporting for more value?
What about transactional data?  How would the HUB need to change to support this?
What about daily account data?  How would the HUB need to change to support this?
What about Change Data Capture?  Where is the best place for this?  Could we ever load daily full files (is there enough time in a day)?

How does the physical model need to change to support our future direction?
Can you/would you ever really build the marts off of the WH?



We need to get a game plan FAST!!!  Let me know when you can discuss.

Hi Guys,

As you are aware, Mike would like me to become more involved in Presentations.  He has tasked me to research information to update and enhance the attached Value & Direction Presentation, presented to Paul on April 27, 2009.  This version has been amended to include some of the questions that Paul wants addressed before presenting to Leon Wilson.  Please view in notes page format to see the information that Paul would like to see added, with the exception of slides 6 & 7, which are Mike's notes.  I am also including a spreadsheet converted from the  Decision Support Value slide 8.  I am looking for The Technologies Used here.  I have requested Project Cost Workbooks from Scott Haynes to gather all costs associated with the Warehouse. 

I will be scheduling a small amount of time with all of you to get information that pertains to you.  More specifically, the categories are as follows:

Jan - Data Governance
Susan - Show Strategy - Show migration of where we are today to the Warehouse.  How are we going to get to the Warehouse?

Steve - Decision Support Value - What was cost to produce these applications?  Resources?

Please give this some thought and add any ideas that you think are relevant.  We will omit what is not needed as we finalize the presentation.

Thank you for your help.

Deena  I am working on multiple fronts (brainstorming with Sam on the overall structure, content & direction to our pitch, with Henry to finalize current & future state architecture diagrams & derive actionable IT goals by drilling down from GoldBank businesss long term strategic goals and 2009 goals, as well as with our offshore team to pull together the blocks for the BICC part of our presentation).



I have attached a one-slider TOC which will give you a sense for how these pieces would eventually fit together into the larger presentation in terms of a logical flow. However, each of these individual pieces is still WIP and not in a format that I am comfortable with yet to share with this group. I am expecting to be ready to share a draft with all these pieces in it by Monday 8th June.



Progress on the presentation has been slower than where I expected us to be at this time (for e.g. there has been a lot of fluidity with the way the architecture discussion has shaped up..) but I am seeing good momentum on each of the fronts and am expecting to be able to pull together stuff we can review and comment on starting Monday.



I will also be setting up a daily review call next week for us to get together to review & track the progress of the presentation. I apologize about not being able to provide you with an update on this sooner.

Deena - I am not sure if Sam has other thoughts, but from my perspective, I would think sometime early next weekfor a strawman review.



Things are a bit fluid at the moment as we are brainstorming our best going in strategies (given GoldBanks current state) & collecting data points to support our point of view & solidify what we think will be received well I am expecting that once we have a strawman that we are comfortable with; progress will be much more faster as we will have clarity on what needs to be achieved on each piece and I will be able to help drive this forward more effectively.



We should probably look to have daily checkpoint calls starting ~8th June or so. Let me know if you have any questions.

Deena, I wanted to try & finalize my travel to Atlanta (based on our discussion from yesterday) to spend time with Henry & Sam next week (28th / 29th May).



Sam mentioned that I should check with you on the project code that I should use to book this on Bannockburn. Can you let me know which code I should use for this please?



Thanks

Deena, Sam  do we have a  sense as to how much time we are expected to get in order to present our pitch for this opportunity?



Since the  topic is broad & I am expecting that we will want to cover selected areas in more detail to establish our credentials as a true BI Partner; I am trying to determine how best to start structuring our thoughts in order to create the outlines of the deck that we will use finally. If we are in a position to ask GoldBank for a block of time, my initial thoughts based on the information I have heard / reviewed so far is that we will need 1.5  2 hrs to cover what we come up with.



Please let me know your thoughts on this.



Thanks,
Raghu

Henry,



After much discussion, I think we have decided that we need to work together initially as a small, core team to produce a presentation for Mike, Susan and others in June on the future Data Management Strategy for GoldBank.  We can pull ideas and expertise from across the FS-GBU, but we (and you) are really the most qualified and capable of driving the story and we can work more efficiently if we pull our story together as tight, core group, before involving too many other people.



The brief background for Raghu is that GoldBank has invited Tata and CTS in for presentations to determine an IT BI Partner for 2010.  We will give more background on our pursuit kick-off call.



I will ask Raghu to help us coordinate a discussion tomorrow morning, if possible, to begin development of a draft presentation by next Friday.  I think our date for the actual presentation is the 2nd week of June and Deena will confirm.  I suggest a call at 10:00 AM ET tomorrow if it works for Henry and Raghu.

Not sure if you have come out of your SEBI meeting yet.


I wanted to speak with you for a brief couple of mins about the stuff I mentioned below  Deena was suggesting that since you spent time on the FirstBank account; perhaps you could help augment the BICC case study we have for FirstBank with some specifics around the way the FirstBank client team(s) were set up and how we aligned with FirstBank IT to offer specific actionable services (some examples) that enabled better alignment with the business etc..the current case study on FirstBank is pretty high level and lacks specific detail that Mike / Susan or even Will Shupe will be interested in as they would tend to view FirstBank not as a peer bank (unless we are able to go back with the right level of detail around our success story there). I am not sure if we have any other client case study for a successful BICC implementation where we can equate the client as a peer bank for GoldBank.

I need to get as much of the BICC story in place as possible by tomorrow noon my time when we are slated to review this deckthis is because Deena & Sam are going to be in day long meetings on Thursday and I wont be able to get hold of them on that date and need to get as much accomplished and reviewed tomorrow as possible.

I also need your personal help & involvement to review the BICC portion that has been delivered so far as the story is currently disjointed with not much of a logical flowalso it is missing some other critical pieces that make a BICC program successful and viewed as comprehensive (People, processes, tools etc..). We also need to have very specific recommendations for the short term, medium term & long term on how we will enable IT to be more successfulit would be great if you can spend some time on this with Sandesh & Harshpal todaywe can talk in more detail on the call at 12 pm EST tomorrow my time (9:30 pm this evening your time)

This is very good. I think you captured and represented the discussion very well. Just a few comments,

1. The standards and guidelines were not set only by the global architecture group and just followed by the specific area teams. Actually the specific area teams/groups were the drivers for setting up the standards and guidelines which were reviewed by the architecture group. For example the data modeling standards were defined by the data modeling group itself.
2. The last slide combines two different things firstly the things that contributed to making this successful and the benefits of this model. I think we should separate these two out on different slides.


Let me know if you have any questions.

·         15 offshore ( team lead, BA, developer pool, testing pool, reporting pool)

§  Production support team  1 onsite  8 to 10 offshore ( if this is feasible)

·         Some kind of communication flow for an offshore model.

·         A financial model based on the above. Use the current rate and show a blended rate.

Subject: Different packaging



Deena,

This approach is going to sound dramatically different, but it is the same.   All of the architecture diagrams still fit.  The difference is solely in what they LABEL this application which is already developed today.   This approach is proposing to label this thing a data warehouse NOW.   It fits the definition.   It means no more throw away work. It means they have accomplished their goal after all of these years.  I think this concept will be more difficult to sell \"down\" than \"up\" but that may be of little importance.   I believe this will either give us a slam dunk or permanently eliminate us from consideration:) 

Also, I'm trying to wrap a lot more business case around this. 

Got to begin that long journey from Spring City, TN to Charlotte now.   I'll be stopping in Greenville, SC later tonight.  You can call me in the car if you want to discuss.  



The Punch Line
No change in approach or recommendation
·       Data warehouse definition
·       History  3.5 years

1       Subject oriented - Lending
2       Integrated  11 lending systems, GL and corporate hierarchies
3       Xxx

·       Not part of Data warehousing definition
·       What type of database structures to use

1       What tool to use (i.e. BDW)
2       Enterprise or not  there are functional warehouses

The Data Warehouse is now Built!

	+ The only change is applying the label DW to what you have now  
Lending Data Warehouse 0.1- 2009
Lending oriented with financial top of the house reporting capability including reconciliation capabilities.  It can easily be considered a Data Warehouse based on classic definition and components. 

Business

	+ Includes data from most major lending systems including 214 Data Elements documented to support BASEL reporting
	+ Includes data from General Ledger which will support top of the house reporting and allow integration of data with lending systems  i.e. GL codes could be broken down by loan quality.  
	+ Includes major corporate hierarchies for the Organization and GL which will support high level reports and the ability to drill down to detail


Technical

	+ Includes Master Data Management (MDM) interface and capability
	+ Supports conformance of data across disparate sources
	+ Supports Conformed Dimensions / Data Bus
Use

	+ Only used by single LOB / CCRM
	+ Data Definitions in MDM layer are defined by CCRM
	+ Reports will initially be targeted for CCRM


Opportunity

	+ This lending data could be leveraged across multiple LOBS
	+ Cost savings could be achieved by sharing this data  from both LOB and IT perspective
	+ Several legacy systems can already be targeted for eventual shutdown  DRL, BLA
	+ Data definitions are not universally accepted, but they are a great start and can be used to accelerate the interest in common definitions


Lending Data Warehouse 1.0 -  2010 
Warehouse is built out to support two additional LOBs  Finance and DRL. 

Business

	+ CCRM includes remaining lending sources
	+ CCRM builds out all lending sources to support 214 Data Elements BASEL data   
	+ CCRM Chargeback and recovery information added
	+ DRL adds Yield file from CLS and Credit officer information
DRL group develops BI reporting on this Lending data allowing for sun setting of BDW / DRL
	+ Finance leverages data in the warehouse to support external modeling efforts such as Economic Capital.
	+ Finance enriches the data with Economic Capital models including results and driving parameters
	+ Enriched data from Finance is loading back into the warehouse 
	+ Customer subject area is enriched including demographic and relationship information


Technical

	+ Master Data Management component is separated from warehouse and shared by LOBs
	+ Supports conformance of data across disparate sources and across LOBS
	+ Allows for differences in interpretation across LOBS if necessary
	+ Customer Relationship information is implemented in 3NF. 
	+ BDW / M1 and the currently implemented models will be the logical Basis of a new physically tuned model. 
Use

	+ Used by at least three LOBs
	+ Data Definitions in enhanced  MDM layer are defined by multiple LOBS
	+ Lending data reports in conjunction with MDM layer reports are a catalyst for accelerated Data Governance Program
Opportunity

	+ Data is being shared across multiple LOBs now and there is an inventory of reports  this usually results in a spiked level of demand and enhancements.    
	+ A core team will need to be established which will oversee independent development efforts
	+ DRL mart and DW / Project Q220  can be retired after this information is included in DW V2
	+ GL and Officer DW / Project Q310 can be retired after this information is included in DW V2

Deena,

Here are several sample reports. Please DO NOT distribute these reports to anyone as some of the reports may have confidential information.  Most of these reports were created by me. Please feel free to give me a call if you have any question. All of these reports are for Wealth Management group. The good thing is that Wealth Management LOBs use all the products offered by a bank. Therefore the KPIs you will see in these reports can be easily transported to other LOBs and for consolidated reporting of the bank.

Subject: Finance KPI's for GoldBank



Sam asked me to check with you if you can help us put together KPIs for finance organization for a Bank. This is for GoldBank. It would be just a sample. Based on the KPIs we want to check if the  current warehouse work we have already done can be leveraged for Finance and other groups.



Please let me know by tomorrow.  Call me if you need some clarification.

Thanks,

From finance reporting point of view a report that is always appreciated by the LOB executives is the loan roll forward report. Do they currently have such report at Gbank? A roll forward report in general starts with the prior months outstanding and shows new loans, run offs, pay downs etc. to come up with current months outstanding. At present do you have all the data to create such reports? Another key management information is the spread analysis. Is the credit data mart storing the spread information?



This is my initial thought. I will let you know if I think of some other enhancements. I think we should have a phone conversation so that we can be on the same page.

Subject: Discussion about Finance Dashboards



Ashok,



Since we could not talk today (Voice Plus is still down), I am sending my thoughts about this topic:

1. I will get the reports sanitized in next few days.
2. We have built a credit risk data mart at Gbank. This data mart includes loan data which contains: products, GL codes, geography, LOB, cost center and usual loan related facts like credit scores, delinquency, balances etc. We are thinking of proposing enhancements to this data mart so that it can serve needs of groups other than credit risk. For example,
	1. Add deposits data
	2. Add GL data at transaction level
	3. Add originations data
Adding this data will give ability to create some of the dashboards you have sent. Also, it will make the mart suitable for finance reporting.



What I need from you is:

1. What enhancements do you suggest to a credit risk data mart to make it more of central repository for entire financial reporting? Some examples I have listed above.
2. Can you convert the report in KRIs so that we can build some prototype for Gbank?


Looking forward to your reply.



Thanks,

Also, I have asked them to read Section III  Our Corporate Overview  and make sure that the content provided is our most up-to-date FS GBU overview.



Kelly Jones in Legal is reviewing the NDA contained within Section I.

I do not think that a new NDA is needed, because we already have an executed Mutual Confidentiality Agreement in place with GoldBank.

I am hoping Kelly will provide me with language to that effect that I can put in Section I in place of the NDA.



Ashish and Mukta are putting the staffing, pricing and expenses into the DataTech IMPACT Pricing Model to confirm our CM%.

I will receive that info tomorrow (Tues) morning.



I will make sure that final RFP Response is submitted to GoldBank before the due date and time, which is this Thursday, July 2 @ 4:00 PM EDT.

Sam,

Do you all have any experience in developing an appraisal compliance tracking solution? What I'm talking about here would include a simple front-end (maybe an Excel template with some VB behind it) that will capture the data around your appraisal process and then a DB (probably SQL) that maintains the data and allows you to report on it. Probably 50 data elements. Around 10-15K appraisals a year run through it. I thought maybe you guys may have built something like this before we could leverage to a quick and cheap solution. We need something probably in next 30-45 days and would like to keep below $100K. Thoughts? Thanks.

If he is going to populate it internally, that's different.  First I would ask how he is going to acquire all of these appraisals and who is going to key them in internally.  

For Infrastructure, this does not sound like a Microstrategy application.   Keith mentioned SQL Server and if he has one available, that would be a possibility.   DB2 has too much GoldBank process wrapped around it to do anything is ths dollarframe.  It's small enough for Access also.   

For a potential small scale solution I should suggest that:

1) We've all got appraisals so I suspect we could get someone to throw together the list of data elements.  
2) Recommend to put together an Access front end on SQL Server or even Access. 
3) Get someone to anticipate what kind of queries might be run against it 
4) Make a proposal out of it
5) No Integration with anything at this point. 

For a more \"robust\" solution, we could use the \"User Defined Area\" or UDA of our data warehouse.  This is where the user can maintain hierarchies, descriptions and other information that comes in \"externally\" from our defined sources.   We could create the tables there - do a more robust modeling solution, and then provide Access front-end.   This would also give us the potential for profiling to see how data might merge with the mart and also the possibility of other reporting.

I agree with Tom for what sounds like half data-entry application.�� What I would add is \"who\" is going�enter the data.�� If Keith wants this out in the field, I don't think we can begin to develop a web based application, get it online, and get folks trained in this dollar or time frame.�

If he is going to populate it internally, that's different.� First I would ask how he is going to acquire all of these appraisals and who is going to key them in internally.��

For Infrastructure, this does not sound like a Microstrategy application.�� Keith mentioned SQL Server and if he has one available, that would be a possibility.�� DB2 has too much GoldBank process wrapped around it to do anything is ths dollarframe.� It's small enough for�Access also.� �

For a potential small scale solution I should suggest that:

1) We've all got appraisals so I suspect we could get someone to throw together the list of data elements.��
2) Recommend to put together an Access front end on SQL Server or even Access.�
3) Get someone to anticipate�what kind of queries might be run against it�
4)�Make a proposal out of it
5) No Integration with anything at this point.�

For a more \"robust\" solution, we could use the \"User Defined Area\" or UDA of our data warehouse.� This is where the user can maintain hierarchies, descriptions and other information that comes in \"externally\" from our defined sources.�� We could create the tables there - do a more robust modeling solution, and then provide Access front-end.�� This would also give us the potential for profiling to see how data�might merge with the mart and�also the possibility�of other reporting.� �

Subject: RE: Appraisal Compliance Tracking

Where is the appraisal data stored currently? It almost sounds like they want some front end process for people to enter the data and then capture it into a DB to run reports. We get into a lot of potential complexities around identifying and coding for controls for data entry, etc. Some additional Issues Questions:

1.������ We would need to identify the parameters for each field… (e.g. defaults, required vs. optional, etc.)

2.������ Would some get pre-populated from another system? If so, what are the sources

3.������ Would the reports require joining this appraisal DB with another system?

4.������ Would there be an editing capability required… The ability to go in and edit a record that had already been submitted?



Just a couple of questions and thoughts for consideration…



Thanks

Gene,



Can you run with this request?� I’ve alerted Keith that we are looking into it.� I’m not sure we want to do it, but want to ask the team.



Can you find out from Henry/Beth/kishor why we would not load this data into CCRM – perhaps because it’s operational data about the day-to-day appraisal process.



Howard and Tom could tell us if we have built this application at TD or Compass.



Also, we need to determine if this is really something that TD might want to build (would have to be very cheap or if BIM India wants to build the front� -end.



This is such a small budget, we will need folks in the distribution to weigh in with your opinions quickly.



Regards,

Sam,

Do you all have any experience in developing an appraisal compliance tracking solution? What I'm talking about here would include a simple front-end (maybe an Excel template with some VB behind it) that will capture the data around your appraisal process and then a DB (probably SQL) that maintains the data and allows you to report on it. Probably 50 data elements. Around 10-15K appraisals a year run through it. I thought maybe you guys may have built something like this before we could leverage to a quick and cheap solution. We need something probably in next 30-45 days and would like to keep below $100K. Thoughts? Thanks.

I took a few minutes and tried to get this out of the blocks.  See attached. Admittedly, I am working in a vacuum and have provided some fairly generic material.  I came up with like 6 Building Blocks of this program but believe I probably left out three or four critical areas or perhaps described it in the wrong way.  Feel free to add to my list or to modify. Please try to push this forward, though, as much as you can and Henry can help shape it tomorrow.  Below are some of my thoughts on how to tackle the sections assigned to you:



III.      Proposed Data Architecture Strategy. 5



Re-Use the work you are doing with Henry on the extension SoW/Proposal and the work that has been ongoing in documenting the new architecture ideas.  Try to write a narrative overview that describes the Why and the goals and objectives of the new proposed architecture approach.  Try to tie the new architectural approach to the other shared services we are proposing in the CoE.  For example, how will the architecture help improve shared ETL services?  Shared modeling services?  More effective Support Services?.

IV.     Collaborative Engagement Model 6

IV.A      Data Application Development 6



Perhaps this should be broken into Architecture and Modeling Services, ETL Services, Testing Services, Reporting & Advanced Analytical Services (btw, advanced analytics is an area we havent promoted very much with Mike/Susan, but would seem to really elevate their value if they could deploy through us).  We should show an organizational model here that shows the offshore pools and the key on-site leadership. 

IV.B      Production Support 6



Hoping you have some fairly standard material for this section.  We developed some newer material for TD Bank at one point, but you guys know better than I.

V.       High Level Transition Plan. 7

V.A       Implementation Plan with Stages and Milestones. 7



Im thinking a description here with chevron graphics to show the major phases.  Perhaps there is a second area that looks more like a high-level gantt chart and has key milestones highlighted.  I havent even begun to think them through, so you guys make them up with your knowledge of where the program is possibly headed. 

VI.     Budget & Business Case. 8



If we have good examples from other work at GE or FirstBank, lets try to include a model here from another client that has moved to RightShore BIM services.  I continue to be dissapointed that FirstBank never has anything around business case to share and Deena says she has nothing here either.  I may make this up tomorrow if we dont have a starting place.



Instead of a typical project budget, I think this section tries to highlight the areas of savings or business lift and perhaps we use GoldBank own Capital Expense template, which calculates a Net Present Value.  Just a thought.

7         Page 3  Do we want to put Henry and Praveens names?

7         Page 4  Reduce cost of data application development Is there any way for us to show this.

7         On Page 3 we have described a jointly staffed onsite  team along with a ETL factory, testing group and a reporting team. Can we show this in a picture form in our Engagement Model section.  If this could show how the overall team structure will look like including production support. Also may be a resourcing strategy which could indicate how we leverage resources like ( BAs, testers and ETL developers across projects  which may be at different stages.

7         We have lot of details on the production support side. I am sure there are some very good practices or delivery processes and reporting that Henry uses today on the project that Mike may not be aware of. Can we add that in.

7         Another thought  Do we propose a small engagement where we can formally engage with Mike and his team in the initiatives that they are taking up for the next year and jointly come up with the approach for 2010 and a roadmap for future. This should entail jointly going with them to business meetings and helping in crafting the solutions or the projects.

I made some changes in section 3 and section 4.   There were a few differences that were fairly significant between what is on the table and what was in the document.  Key point (and difference) is that the BDW as-is completely goes away.  There is no more feeding the USM as the mart loads.   MSTG is the new \"tuned\" USM.       

Section 5 needs to be removed completely.  It is not in-sync with what has been proposed either from a time line or from the task perspective.     .  

For section 5 and 6, Susan has already put a plan with cost and effort and time (for planning purposes) in front of Mike for the CCRM / LDW effort.   We should not do anything different here.   If our point is to sell other services, show rate cards and levels that is different.  But we cannot show a plan that does not resemble what has been socialized with them so far for CCRM / LDW.    

In short, the CCRM / LDW evolution proposal has already been presented at some detail.  It has been socialized with Mike, Kenny, Susan and Jan - the key leaders in SDS.   There is a marker on the budget with cost and resources.  We need an overview here, but I've made some changes to ensure we are not contradictory with where we are.  To me, this needs to be about something more……

A member of our offshore team has given us feedback that kishor had approached him and implied that there was a lot of work performed from home, that this was generally not acceptable and that it might impact performance reviews.   Of course, this caused the employee a lot of concern as it did me.

This specifically deals with our testing team.  For several weeks in a row, these guys were literally expected to watch and run our data loads 24 hours a day.  In my mind, it is not reasonable to have someone come into work at 3 am, 4 am, 5 am, etc to watch loads run.  Likewise, if someone is up all night running these loads, I would not expect them to be onsite at work during normal work hours.   I personally approved this work from home method of operation during these exception times.   It is not being used now, nor was it being used before this critical time.

I have great appreciation for these guys and the dedication they showed to do this 24 hour work.  To have them reprimanded for this amount of effort seems totally unreasonable to me. 

That all being said, I obviously am not in touch with the culture there.  However, these guys were working under the permission we gave them and they showed extreme dedication.  I do not believe they should be having their performance reviews threatened.  If this was the wrong approach I will do it differently next time.  Please place the blame on me for this misstep, but please thank Parag and Mahesh for their hard work and let them know that their dedication will not go unnoticed at review time.

All, 

A member of our offshore team has given us feedback that kishor had approached him and implied that there was a lot of work performed from home, that this was generally not acceptable and that it might impact performance reviews.   Of course, this caused the employee a lot of concern as it did me.

This specifically deals with our testing team.  For several weeks in a row, these guys were literally expected to watch and run our data loads 24 hours a day.  In my mind, it is not reasonable to have someone come into work at 3 am, 4 am, 5 am, etc to watch loads run.  Likewise, if someone is up all night running these loads, I would not expect them to be onsite at work during normal work hours.   I personally approved this work from home method of operation during these exception times.   It is not being used now, nor was it being used before this critical time.

I have great appreciation for these guys and the dedication they showed to do this 24 hour work.  To have them reprimanded for this amount of effort seems totally unreasonable to me. 

That all being said, I obviously am not in touch with the culture there.  However, these guys were working under the permission we gave them and they showed extreme dedication.  I do not believe they should be having their performance reviews threatened.  If this was the wrong approach I will do it differently next time.  Please place the blame on me for this misstep, but please thank Parag and Mahesh for their hard work and let them know that their dedication will not go unnoticed at review time.

Henry,



What I discussed was that when there is no 24x7 work, try to avoid working from home. Also, if possible, onsite team can also do loads and monitoring. Working from home facility is not available for everyone and few associates have expressed issues over this. I can definitely understand need to work 24x7 and have done it myself previously.



There was definitely no talk of being reprimanded.



Having said this, my attempt was to avoid further issues (which I foresee happening) but if it is taken in a different way, let me back out and not take this topic further.



Finally, I greatly appreciate hard work Mahesh and Parag have done and have informed them about this in email as well as verbally as late as August. Praveen, I am sure this has not been informed to you.



Thanks,

As you should be aware, the offshore team is \"fragile\" now.   We've had a tremendous amount of turnover and we have a number of flight risk resources right now.  I feel that the open communication is good.  Hopefully, nothing will be done that might make people afraid that they cannot communicate.  In my mind, this is a management issue and not a team issue.  One half of the management team was saying that at home work was fine and the other half was saying that there might be problems and it might impact appraisals.  That is clearly a problem we as management need to address and be consistent on.

Hi Santosh,



Sweta and I are in the process of surveying literature related to model validation. It appears that not much is available online specifically on loan book capital model validation. As it appears, loan book capital model validation should not be much different than model validation pertaining to credit risk models. At max there can be an overlap with operational risk model validation. That kind of operational risk which can impact the lending portfolio of a bank.



In light of the above, please find enclosed an excel containing todays updates on literature survey. We shall add more with time. I also suggest we create a sharepoint node similar to the one that Suresh had created for the Fiserv project.

Eric,



Sorry for the delay in my response. I was on vacation and am back in the saddle.



Based on the project scope the qualitative assessment and chWhiteging the model will be done by me. I have attached my resume for your perusal.  The other folks on the team are mid / junior folks who will be validating the SAS code and conducting the research on my behalf. They have been supporting me on credit risk projects for the last few years. kishor Deshpande who will be managing the India team has also worked on-site with GoldBank with the credit risk group. I can send you their resumes as well if you are interested tomorrow.



Having said that we do have some additional PhDs / Senior SMEs in Netherlands who have considerable experience in this field.  We could involve them in the project to provide a qualitative assessment in addition to the one I would be providing. However, we have not budgeted for the activity in the current proposal. If you are interested in involving them, please let me know as I can then get their availability and provide you a estimate of the additional expense to GoldBank.



Please let me know if you have some time tomorrow to discuss this. I am open in the afternoon after 1. Let me know what time works for you.



Regards,



Santosh

Santosh - Greetings!

Hope all is going well in your world!  I'm sure Gene has communicated some of the struggles we're having here at GoldBank to get this project underway.  I want to communicate directly to you that I am working diligently to keep everything moving forward and that I sincerely appreciate DataTech's patience and understanding.

Also, I need a little help with one hurdle I am currently trying to surmount.  While I am not concerned, senior management here would like to see more details on the credentials of you and your team in undertaking this validation.  While no one is worried about DataTech's experience, as evidenced by page 15 of the proposal, they would like to know more about your experience as well as anyone you will have working on the team. 

Specifically they are looking for more comfort in you and your team's:

* Ability to sufficiently chWhitege the model's theoretical framework
* Economic background
* Economic Capital Modeling experience


Of course anything else that will support your team's ability to complete the validation will be appreciated!

Again I appreciate your understanding.  This model is getting a lot of regulatory energy and that is making a lot of senior people uncomfortable.  I just need you to help me prove you are the right choice!

Hope that makes sense; please let me know if you have any questions.
I'll look forward to your response!  Thanks Santosh!

It make more sense to be on the project when I am not there. I would definitely recommend you to be involved. Also, I will be involved from a QA perspective as I want to hear what Marco has to say too. Also, we are meeting Barbara Duck this week. EC will roll into her and I may get involved.

I will be going back on 31st. SOW for Westpac is not yet signed and even if it is done, its just a 2 week project. Mostly Kundan Joshi and Howard / Adolph will work on it.

So I am available for any work from offshore. Do you have any projects that I can do from India? How about GoldBank Model validation? Anything else?

Subject: FW: Submission of final EC1 validation report (version 1.1)
Importance: High



Dear Gene, Dear Santosh,



Please find attached our final report for GoldBank. In todays teleconference we discussed their comments to the previous version, and we have adjusted the report accordingly. They accept the delivery of this final report and that closes our assignment.



My impression is that they are positive about DataTech and the result of the validation.



There is one issue that needs to be resolved.



Please take a close look at the report; we suggest a number of times that more diagnostics / tests are needed. See eg p. 43, item #22. These items point out to GoldBank that we identified critical procedures in the code where things can go wrong and diagnostics are needed to check whether the variables that are calculated have the proper distributional properties.



We have performed many tests during the validation, including a so-called spanning control, in which I have built an Economic Capital estimate of myself in MATLAB in order to have an independent check on the order of magnitude of the EC that they compute (see section 5.4 The Spanning Control). The MATLAB code has been delivered to GoldBank (it is in the report, in the appendix). On top of that, Gaurav and Jessica spent much time on the end-to-end replication and file comparisons that are reported in section 5.3.



In my opinion we have done much more than what was strictly necessary from the statement of work. I have spent much more time than 10 days for my analysis and the writing of the report. I have no problem with this. Jessica and Gaurav have been working very hard on the IT findings and the replication of the code. Especially Gaurav has been available to me day and night.



The issue is: Eric wants DataTech to follow up on the detailed tests (such as the one quoted above on p. 43, item #22) and to perform these tests within the current assignment. I have told Eric that we will be glad to do this follow-up analysis but within the scope of a new assignment. I have not told Eric that I have spent much more time than 10 days for my analysis and the writing of the report. My impression is that Eric acknowledges that he cannot exactly require us to follow up on these additional tests within the scope of the current assignment, but that he wants to negotiate on this. It is strange that he mentions this now, since the GoldBank steering committee could follow our progress exactly and all steering committee teleconference have been documented by us.



Do not understand me wrong here, I do have the impression that GoldBank is satisfied with the results and that these results comply with the SOW. However, Eric wants DataTech to perform additional analysis and he wants to talk to Gene about the conditions.



I would like to evaluate the assignment with the two of you during a teleconference. Please let me know when this would be convenient for you (preferable early next week).

Can you please help to obtain a couple of profiles on QlikView? As per the discussion with Jagdish GoldBank needs help with deployment of the tool and with designing and developing reports on this reporting platform.



If we need more clarity around technical skills before we can provide profiles, I can setup a call with GoldBank.



The start time is conservatively estimated to be no later than July end  selecting profiles in the next 2-3 weeks and completing contracting process over 2-3 weeks after that.

This is just for your reference right now. Let me know if when you need resources so I can identify who can be deployed. The rate will fit in the rate card and will be around $83.

My memory from the request from Deena is that the CVs came from Morgan and may not be CVs that would be available for July start.  I need kishor or Yogita to help me see their availability.  We also have several new Consulting level resources with Cognos skills.  I would like to send them through a boot camp training, which is very feasible, if GoldBank will accept them.  Qlikview is a pretty niche skill at this point, so I can’t imagine it will be very easy to find, and we can bring both domain expertise and the technical skills, so we just need to sell and educate properly.  We can find ways to stand behind there performance.



Jayme suggests there is a contractor out of Atlanta who really was the anchor of the Morgan team and that we should find him.  Jayme is cc’d on this note.



Finally, there is probably a lot of more consultative services we can provide the folks in specialized lending.  Let’s do find a way to meet with them and to ask questions and demonstrate our value beyond the staffing services we can provide.

Thank you for the quick response. I have the same understanding from Deena that these are sample profiles. I just wanted to check if by chance any of them were coming free for a July timeframe.



Having said that this will be our first shot at Specialized Lending. We need to meet their immediate need in a credible way by providing resources they need now. Any immediate discussion we have should be focused on understanding the QlikView needs so that we can source the right profiles.



Gene already is heading up a thread to understand their broader needs; we will get a chance later to discuss their broader needs – broader BIM as well as other practice areas. Some meetings are planned for later this month.



Gene/Deena – any thoughts from your side?

Please go ahead and begin discussions w/ Phil and provide him with what you know about the role. I think we will need back-up. My feeling is that someone w/ very good skills with SQL and experience on a platform like Cognos and related domain skills will be far more effective, given some training, than someone who might have learned the Qlikview tool somewhere.� I don’t think the tool is very difficult.



Maybe we need to offer the re-tooled & trained Cognos guys for 2 weeks at no charge, along with an experienced lead person on the platform.



As always, as consultants, it’s much better to have dialogue with the client to tailor our services to their requirement.� I think it’s great to grow through staffing requirements and to take advantage of our model to grow and scale, but we must continue to be creative and to bring some incremental benefit vs. Sogeti, CTS or the local IT staffing firm that takes 10% margin on bodies.

Sam



Thank you for the quick response. I have the same understanding from Deena that these are sample profiles. I just wanted to check if by chance any of them were coming free for a July timeframe.



Having said that this will be our first shot at Specialized Lending. We need to meet their immediate need in a credible way by providing resources they need now. Any immediate discussion we have should be focused on understanding the QlikView needs so that we can source the right profiles.



Gene already is heading up a thread to understand their broader needs; we will get a chance later to discuss their broader needs – broader BIM as well as other practice areas. Some meetings are planned for later this month.



Gene/Deena – any thoughts from your side?

Madhu,



My memory from the request from Deena is that the CVs came from Morgan and may not be CVs that would be available for July start.� I need kishor or Yogita to help me see their availability.� We also have several new Consulting level resources with Cognos skills.� I would like to send them through a boot camp training, which is very feasible, if GoldBank will accept them.� Qlikview is a pretty niche skill at this point, so I can’t imagine it will be very easy to find, and we can bring both domain expertise and the technical skills, so we just need to sell and educate properly.� We can find ways to stand behind there performance.



Jayme suggests there is a contractor out of Atlanta who really was the anchor of the Morgan team and that we should find him.� Jayme is cc’d on this note.



Finally, there is probably a lot of more consultative services we can provide the folks in specialized lending.� Let’s do find a way to meet with them and to ask questions and demonstrate our value beyond the staffing services we can provide.

This is just for your reference right now. Let me know if when you need resources so I can identify who can be deployed. The rate will fit in the rate card and will be around $83.

Gene already is heading up a thread to understand their broader needs; we will get a chance later to discuss their broader needs – broader BIM as well as other practice areas. Some meetings are planned for later this month.



Gene/Deena – any thoughts from your side?

My memory from the request from Deena is that the CVs came from Morgan and may not be CVs that would be available for July start.� I need kishor or Yogita to help me see their availability.� We also have several new Consulting level resources with Cognos skills.� I would like to send them through a boot camp training, which is very feasible, if GoldBank will accept them.� Qlikview is a pretty niche skill at this point, so I can’t imagine it will be very easy to find, and we can bring both domain expertise and the technical skills, so we just need to sell and educate properly.� We can find ways to stand behind there performance.



Jayme suggests there is a contractor out of Atlanta who really was the anchor of the Morgan team and that we should find him.� Jayme is cc’d on this note.



Finally, there is probably a lot of more consultative services we can provide the folks in specialized lending.� Let’s do find a way to meet with them and to ask questions and demonstrate our value beyond the staffing services we can provide.

There are 5-6 resources in Morgan. Deena has already written to Murali asking if Morgan can release one of them. We have specifically asked for seniormost guy who has established model in Morgan.

If the team at Morgan is of a reasonable size it will be good if we can explore options to pull out one experienced person (perhaps located offshore now) and backfill with a trained resource there. That may be less of a risk in a reasonable size team than at GoldBank where we will have only 2 resources.

I hate to say I’m not sure, but that’s the truth at this point.� kishor and Yogita will tell us if there is any way to rotate someone from offshore.� Jayme will help us track down the sub we know in Atlanta and we will get some of our hot-shot consultants trained.� Let’s watch it closely, but also realize this is a very niche set and we don’t operate w/ any kind of bench for esoteric skills like Qlikview.� I think we were lucky to have the team at Morgan going.

Subject: RE: QlickView profiles.

Please go ahead and begin discussions w/ Phil and provide him with what you know about the role. I think we will need back-up. My feeling is that someone w/ very good skills with SQL and experience on a platform like Cognos and related domain skills will be far more effective, given some training, than someone who might have learned the Qlikview tool somewhere.� I don’t think the tool is very difficult.



Maybe we need to offer the re-tooled & trained Cognos guys for 2 weeks at no charge, along with an experienced lead person on the platform.



As always, as consultants, it’s much better to have dialogue with the client to tailor our services to their requirement.� I think it’s great to grow through staffing requirements and to take advantage of our model to grow and scale, but we must continue to be creative and to bring some incremental benefit vs. Sogeti, CTS or the local IT staffing firm that takes 10% margin on bodies.

Vick,

We have a team lead by Amit Somani and Vineet Kumar (both are in US) working
for Morgan QlikView group. They can help in this POC. Their manager has
recommended their names (please see enclosed mail).

Parag Pingle and Mahesh Kale from existing GoldBank offshore team have an
exposure to QlikView. They can be a great help since they understand GoldBank
data structures well. However, I am not aware of their workload and whether
to involve them or not should be decided by Henry.
If Parag and Mahesh are not available, Tushar Bhole can help. He is based
out of Mumbai.

I can also help in the demo as I know QlikView fairly well and also have
worked on demo that was built last year.

Thanks,

Subject: Help w/ Prototype Demo for Mike O'Brien at Gbank

Vick,

Last year we developed a limited reporting demo in the “Qlikview” technology
to demonstrate to Huntington Bank how point in click loan portfolio and risk
management reporting could work.  It was a bit limited, but was a good
start.

I need to demonstrate something very similar to Mike O’Brien within about 2
weeks and hoped you could help me coordinate an effort to build out the
existing demo a bit, polish it and ready it for a quick demonstration.

I suggest finding out from kishor or Virendra who might help us from Mumbai
and then deciding if you want to create a new data set or just extend the
data that we used.   Henry and the GoldBank team might be in a position to give
you the data they used to develop their Microstrategy demo.

I can spend some time to take you through some scenarios and drill paths
that would be interesting and, of course, you have the perfect background to
think this through a bit, too.

Can you help me coordinate this demo and begin working to pull it together?
The tool is incredibly simple and intuitive to use for basic visualizations
and reporting, so I think you can pick it up and help refine the demo
yourself with some help from our offshore guys.

We can discuss for a few minutes tomorrow afternoon.


Thanks,

Sam

Atul is managing the production support group.  I'll look to him to decide
on availability.  


We need to carefully consider whether we want to walk in and do a demo of
THEIR data on a foreign PC.  We could get a negative reaction.   It is
obviously against every security policy they have.  This particular sub
group won't even let our IT group directly access their systems.  They
create a feed and push it to us.   

Alternatively, we could 

ask for permission

ask for permission, but do some data masksing

do it on a GoldBank PC.   I do have a spare.   Need to request userid to be
completely legit

just do it and ask for forgiveness if called.  



I am not trying to stifle progress, but we do have exposure here.

Vick,

We have a team lead by Amit Somani and Vineet Kumar (both are in US) working
for Morgan QlikView group. They can help in this POC. Their manager has
recommended their names (please see enclosed mail).

Parag Pingle and Mahesh Kale from existing GoldBank offshore team have an
exposure to QlikView. They can be a great help since they understand GoldBank
data structures well. However, I am not aware of their workload and whether
to involve them or not should be decided by Henry.
If Parag and Mahesh are not available, Tushar Bhole can help. He is based
out of Mumbai.

I can also help in the demo as I know QlikView fairly well and also have
worked on demo that was built last year.

Thanks,

Subject: Help w/ Prototype Demo for Mike O'Brien at Gbank

Vick,

Last year we developed a limited reporting demo in the \"Qlikview\" technology
to demonstrate to Huntington Bank how point in click loan portfolio and risk
management reporting could work.  It was a bit limited, but was a good
start.

I need to demonstrate something very similar to Mike O'Brien within about 2
weeks and hoped you could help me coordinate an effort to build out the
existing demo a bit, polish it and ready it for a quick demonstration.

I suggest finding out from kishor or Virendra who might help us from Mumbai
and then deciding if you want to create a new data set or just extend the
data that we used.   Henry and the GoldBank team might be in a position to give
you the data they used to develop their Microstrategy demo.

I can spend some time to take you through some scenarios and drill paths
that would be interesting and, of course, you have the perfect background to
think this through a bit, too.

Can you help me coordinate this demo and begin working to pull it together?
The tool is incredibly simple and intuitive to use for basic visualizations
and reporting, so I think you can pick it up and help refine the demo
yourself with some help from our offshore guys.

We can discuss for a few minutes tomorrow afternoon.


Thanks,

Sam

Vick, Amit,



Please find enclosed QlikView demo that we did last year for Hungtinton Bank.

This demo was developed using QlikView 8. So if you are using QlikView 9 demo version for current GoldBank POC, you will not be able to open this file. Amit might have installable for QlikView 8. You can use that.



DataTech has recently purchased QlikView 9 server and we can use this for POC. We have recently received the installable and installation is not done. It might be complete in a week.



Please let me know if you have any questions.



Thanks,

Deena has a communication from Murli that Morgan can release one onsite resource if we can help to find a suitable backfill. We need to finalize who we need to extract from Morgan and who need to back fill with. I infer that you are recommending that we try to extract Amit or Bhaskar.

For QlikView developer, we have following options:

2. Bhaskar Nigam  Is visa ready and very good in reporting. Has previous exposure to Gbank. We have asked Murali for his release.


In addition, I am also checking for Koteshwar Badugu who is visa ready and senior Cognos developer in FirstBank and knows QlikView.



Yogesh and I will work with FirstBank & Morgan teams to let you know availability of these associates in next few days.

I dont have any Qlikview resources on my side for July start; only the representative CVs.  This will have to be a recruiting job unless Morgan can be convinced to rotate someone out and backfill w/ one of our Cognos people that can be trained.  I could use Deenas help in approaching Morgan as I dont have any relationships with these guys and they havent been especially helpful so far.  Jayme and Jim have relationships there and can try to help as well.

Hi Amit,



Thanks for your help. Here are some of my comments. See and incorporate as many as you can and others we can talk through when we meet up tomorrow.



1.    The graph for EC rate, ROA, ROE should be adjacent to the numbers

2.    New objects tab  return will not be a pie, it could be a line graph

3.    New objects tab  the last two bottom graph represents the same

4.    I like the new objects tab  make the size of the graph smaller, also include a outstanding balance graph on this tab. Is it also possible to have a interactive filter on the left in column like you have it for portfolio selection. Where I can clear the filters hitting clear rather than currently clicking the up arrow key

5.    Ensure on summary if the nos. are same there is no arrow or any other indicator other than up or down arrow

6.    Rename New objects tab as Account Mgmt Metrics

7.    In the bottom right graph can you include 60+, 120+  days past due accounts (not 180 since account over 180+ for credit cards are charged-off)

8.    Total charge off should be included in the account mgmt metrics tab and would include:

a.    Charge-off due to Bankruptcy, Fraud and contractual charge-off (for credit cards 181+days past due accounts are charged-off)

b.    Data for all c/o  See the data I have created on tab charge off column BX  CB

c.    In file dashboard graph data 0305, we need to replicate the Charge-Off $ ('000) in tab Charge-off. We would have total charge-off, bk c/o, fraud c/o and 181+dpd (which  is contractual c/o). I have added comments in the attached file in column W for c/o data and BK data

d.    Fraud data  we do not have the total accounts for fraud, we can make that up. Would be good to have graphs indicating  bankruptcy as a % of total gross charge off (page 25 of 36 of the pdf report I sent you 2005-03 Dashboard Us.pdf

e.    In the demo data if you have allowance by account (like you have Economic capital), that would go on Account Mgmt metrics tab as well





Thanks,

Henry, this is a good news. In order to keep our team in tact till the Phase 3 officially starts, below is the proposed allocation (at least starting July).



Production Support :

1.       Mahesh Kale

2.       Lakshman

3.       Renuka



FMER :

1.       Parag Pinglen

2.       Partha Patra

3.       Hemang



Anand will travel to onsite. This way we will be able to retain entire team (Henry, only one change we are proposing is to swap Partha by Lakshman in Prod support)





Whenever we get official confirmation on Phase 3 for offshore staffing , we will re look at the plan and decide how to staff the Phase 3.



Regards,

Yogesh

Gentlemen,

So in theory, on Monday, we will have approval to move with FMER project.  I would suggest that we take the current offshore team and move half to the FMER project.   Based on conversation with Atul, Mahesh and Partha should remain with production support.  When we get the formal approval, we should get Anand's travel in place as soon as possible.  We will need to figure out how to get

We have one large opportunity in that we lost our #1 onshore BA lead.  No one our current team can cover these requirements. 



Madhu,

A SOW patterned after production support SOW should be in Susan's hands now.

Subject: BA for FMER



Deena, Madhu,



I can think of a very good candidate for FMER onsite BA role.



Mayur Nachnani is a BA with experience of working completely on business side with Barclays, RBS & couple of other clients. He has been working with RBS on similar program (regulatory reporting-Solvency II) at London for last few months and will be released from RBS by Mid August.



We have started his US visa processing and he should be travel ready if required by mid  end August.



I am working with Santosh for positioning Mayur for onsite BA roles in consulting projects, but he can be considered for FMER too.



Thanks,

But timing is an issue. GoldBank wants to start this ASAP. One solution is to have a temp now to work on 1 or 2 reporting schedules and then have Mayur come over and take the remaining schedules.



Another possible solution is to take up design and development of one (Deposits) schedule for which requirements were completed internally by GoldBank. Requirements can start in Aug for the other schedules. A pre-req for this is that at least the Hub related design should be complete.



Please take a look at the attached schedule that GoldBank has developed and see if you have any suggestions to move the BA work stream around so that it matches with Mayurs availability. We both can then go back to B&T with some suggestions. This doc is more of a resource plan but has good detail on tasks and timing of the tasks.

I think he has these skills. He did requirement gathering for retail LOB for Barclays and for multiple LOBs in RBS.

He is MBA finance from a leading Indian business school, so accounting skills should not be an issue.



He is GARP certified in International Banking Risk and Regulations (which very few people in CG have).

The deal is officially approved under these terms unless one of you replies back with clarification or a dissenting opinion by close of business tomorrow  you do not need to reply to approve the deal.  The attorney will stay involved with the team and notify us if there are any new issues that need to be reviewed / approved.

I presume these would be offshore based to supplement the onshore resource. Looking at the email Jagdish sent I don't think they want to engage any additional resources in the first 90 days. You probably saw the note from him. Let us talk on Monday.

The note to Amit came in very late for some reason. I will try and call him on Monday.

Madhu,



During week end, I could work out following options for QlikView:-



1.       Partha Patra  He is another good internal option other that Mahesh and Parag. I have worked with Partha on QlikView work in the past and know that he has good QlikView skills. He has worked at onsite for GoldBank and like Mahesh and Parag has excellent knowledge of data.

2.       Pankaj Bajaj  He is senior Cognos developer in FDC account currently in Germany. He is available from 1st week of July. I have asked him to brush up his QlikView skills.



I will send you both these resumes by Monday noon EST.



In the mean time, did you get a chance to check with Amit Somani / Gautam Nehra?

Spoke with Amit. He is keen to come over to GoldBank; looks like he is looking for growth ops. He also mentioned that transition is not a risk from an internal delivery perspective; we can add someone like Anand to the Morgan team as a developer to free up one of the Morgan team members to step up to Amits current role. Amit has been grooming another guy for the last 2-3 years.



Amit also did not have a high opinion of Anand (fit for an entry level Qlikview developer); he thinks Anand is not a good fit for the proposed role at GoldBank i.e. go in and seed a CoE.



In terms of next steps we should make a formal proposition to Morgan to release Amit. I presume it is best of the proposal comes from the practice. If we can finalize this part then we can go back and tell GoldBank that we want to submit another profile that is better suited than Anand for seeding and establishing a Qlikview CoE. Thoughts?



Need to move quickly on this.

Gautam,



We have an urgent requirement in GoldBank for a senior QlikView developer at onsite.

This is a critical position as this is the first time DataTech is working with particular business unit in GoldBank which has largest IT budget in the bank.

In this project client is looking for banking domain experience apart from strong QlikView skills. 



Only client where we are doing QlikView work is Morgan. Amit Somani has strong QlikView experience. Also he has very good banking domain knowledge as he has worked clients like Green Point in the past.



Can you please let us know if Amit can be released from Morgan for GoldBank requirement after a transition is done with a suitable QlikView candidate?



We have already interviewed few candidates for QlikView hiring.



I will call you to discuss this.



Thanks,

The biggest need for them seems to be able to demonstrate the value of using Qlikview to business. So it is a pilot in two senses  demo DataTech capabilities to GoldBank IT and demo Qlikview capabilities to GoldBank business.

I had talk with Kenny for additional buffer for any unexpected event impacting schedule. And He suggested 10- 15% would buffer (175K) would be good to add onto current estimates.

Madhu,



I heard the conversation with Peggy after Parags interview.



She is looking for 10+ years experience at 85 rate. This seems to be impossible. For 85 rate, we need to have at max SC (if we source internally). Getting a SC with 10+ years experience is just not possible. So we will have to go for sub.



I think we need to insist on Parag.

Two quick thoughts… 1) An Issue for Anirban to help as Morgan hasn’t budged on this; 2) We reach out to Qliview directly.  They certainly are already aware of Gbank and try to get help w/ a single expert who can “train the trainers” and work with us “white label.”  You know all the risks of that approach but need to discuss all the options.

Deena, Sam and Madhu:

If Recruiting has no qualified Qlikview candidates in the near term in their Pipeline, how can we roll a qualified resource out of Morgan and provide that person's resume to Jagdish Dassani asap to satisfy GoldBank SLG-IT's need?

Thoughts?
Thanks,

Anand did not make it through an extended screening process at GoldBank. We need additional profiles with strong experience on Qlikview. We can go higher on the cost up to 90-100 USD/hr.

Can you please help to obtain additional profiles?

Sam - GoldBank is also directly approaching QlickView professional services for a resource.  Do we have a good relationship with them. Lets explore if there is opportunity to collaborate. As if this first  project is successful GoldBank will roll out QlickView to other units and wants to build an offshore based COE.

As per our discussion, we recommend that GoldBank engage the attached two profiles for both the short term and the medium term needs which are elaborated below. They both have significant domain & data understanding of the2 BUs, have reasonably good experience with Qlikview, are comfortable with  version 9. They will also have the full access and support of the CoE at no cost to GoldBank.





1.       Short term: GoldBank SLG desires to develop mockups and templates using actual data from one of their business units with an objective of demonstrating the quality, value and usefulness of Qlikview reporting platform to GoldBank business lines. This is a short term activity with a target duration of 30 days. July 25th is when you would like to show case the mockups/templates to business. We can have Parag and Partha develop the mockups offshore on DataTech infrastructure and have one of them travel onshore in time for the Jul 25th timeline for deploying on GoldBank infrastructure and demonstrating to SLG IT and  business. This can be done at a fraction of the cost that you will otherwise spend with Qlikview professional services in this one month. I think the cost will be in the range of 10-15 K USD. If you think getting a SOW done at this stage will delay this initiative we can get started without a SOW. As we have an MSA and NDA in place there should be no issue sharing any data that needs to be used in the reports.



2.       Medium term: GoldBank desire is to leverage an onshore/offshore model to provide build and support services around the Qlikview platform for meeting ongoing reporting needs in various lines of businesses. Parag will be the onshore Qlikview developer/lead and Partha will be offshore Qlikview developer. They will be available at standard MSA rates of 83 USD/hr and 25 USD/hr respectively. Additional offshore developers can be added or removed in a flexible staffing model. Again we will have the full support of the SMEs and leaders of the Qlikview COE to ensure the solutions delivered exceed business expectations.





Knowing this is a pilot run for DataTech and understanding the consequences of failure in this pilot, I am very confident that this recommendation is the best for SLG and will work as the foundation for building your trust on us and our credibility with SLG.



I am also attaching sample work done by the two resources and some additional reports that were done as part of a IP development in our CoE.

Sample reports are attached here. There are 4 sections in the deck. PLEASE VIEW THE DECK IN SLIDE SHOW MODE AS SOME OF THE SLIDES HAVE ANIMATION.



1.       Credit risk and lending monitoring

2.       Transaction monitoring for an European regulator  Partha Patra had worked on this project

3.       Claims monitoring for an Insurance company - Partha Patra had worked on this project

4.       Profitability monitoring and internal reporting for DataTech  Parag Pingle had worked on this project.



I do have another profile but as discussed overall that is an inferior option to what we have recommended here. Please let me know if you have any questions or need to discuss.

As per our discussion, we recommend that GoldBank engage the attached two profiles for both the short term and the medium term needs; our understanding of which is elaborated below. They both have significant domain & data understanding of the2 BUs, have reasonably good experience with Qlikview, are comfortable with  version 9. They will also have the full access and support of the CoE at no cost to GoldBank.





1.       Short term: GoldBank SLG desires to develop mockups and templates using actual data from one of their business units with an objective of demonstrating the quality, value and usefulness of Qlikview reporting platform to GoldBank business lines. This is a short term activity with a target duration of 30 days. July 25th is when GoldBank SLG IT  would like to show case the mockups/templates to business. We can have Parag and Partha develop the mockups offshore on DataTech infrastructure and have one of them travel onshore in time (a week or so) for the Jul 25th timeline for deploying on GoldBank infrastructure and demonstrating to SLG IT and  business. This can be done at a fraction of the cost that you will otherwise spend with Qlikview professional services in this one month. I think the cost will be in the range of 10-15 K USD. If getting a SOW done at this stage will delay this initiative we can get started without a SOW. As we have an MSA and NDA in place there should be no issue sharing any data that needs to be used in the reports.



2.       Medium term: GoldBank desires to leverage an onshore/offshore model to provide build and support services around the Qlikview platform for meeting ongoing reporting needs in various lines of businesses. Parag will be the onshore Qlikview developer/lead and Partha will be offshore Qlikview developer. They will be available at standard MSA rates of 83 USD/hr and 25 USD/hr respectively. Additional offshore developers can be added or removed in a flexible staffing model. Again we will have the full support of the SMEs and leaders of the Qlikview COE to ensure the solutions delivered exceed business expectations.





Knowing this is a pilot run for DataTech and understanding the consequences of failure in this pilot, I am very confident that this recommendation is the best for SLG and will work as the foundation for building your trust in us and our credibility with SLG.



Sample reports are attached here. There are 4 sections in the deck. PLEASE VIEW THE DECK IN SLIDE SHOW MODE AS SOME OF THE SLIDES HAVE ANIMATION.



1.       Credit risk and lending monitoring

2.       Transaction monitoring for an European regulator  Partha Patra had worked on this project

3.       Claims monitoring for an Insurance company - Partha Patra had worked on this project

4.       Profitability monitoring and internal reporting for DataTech  Parag Pingle had worked on this project.



I do have another profile but as discussed overall that is an inferior option to what we have recommended here. Please let me know if you have any questions or need to discuss.

I have also added some more important point, that we need to add as this is on the way to fixed bid.

Apart from this I did not foresee any delivery risks for fixed bid.

Subject: Phase 3 Prep

Atul,



This is all assuming we get Phase 3…..



Current bench situation is very grim. We have 0 bench in Mumbai. Offered candidates are not joining (salary!). There are dozens of pending requisitions for Barclays, RBS etc.

So we have to heavily depend on freshers. This is ground reality. I think ultimately we may end up with 50:50 freshers and experienced people.



So here is what we are planning:



1.       Experienced hiring: we have scheduled a drive for experienced Informatica developers specifically for GoldBank and TD Bank tomorrow. Hope to get at least 2-3 profiles.

2.       Freshers: We have 30 odd freshers available. Parag and Mahesh have selected best 4 of them (which incidentally are batch toppers too). Anand, Partha etc are training these freshers aggressively. I have given them 2 weeks to get these guys up to speed.



Even if phase 3 doesn’t work out, this preparation will be helpful to organization. But if we get phase 3, and do not do this preparation, we will be in deep trouble.



You should ask status of preparation to team (Partha, Mahesh etc) regularly and have a call with new people once a week.



Comments?



Thanks,

Here is my take on it.

The scope and understanding of current 3 project is strong , however all other portions are larger with lesser understanding for doing the fixed bid right now.

It also increases risk if we have them add up to the existing project both delivery and staffing point of view.



We can classify remaining project in 3 parts not in any specific order for future.



I (Potential T&M)

Originations (this is biggest portion with five origination system integration), original estimate for this was over 1 Million.



II (Potential fixed bid).

General Ledger reconciliation

Commercial customer relationships



III (Unsure)

Commercial Risk Grades and Inputs (Risk expert  needed on this)

As per our discussion, we recommend that GoldBank engage the attached two profiles for both the short term and the medium term needs; our understanding of which is elaborated below. They both have significant domain & data understanding of the2 BUs, have reasonably good experience with Qlikview, are comfortable with  version 9. They will also have the full access and support of the CoE at no cost to GoldBank.





1.       Short term: GoldBank SLG desires to develop mockups and templates using actual data from one of their business units with an objective of demonstrating the quality, value and usefulness of Qlikview reporting platform to GoldBank business lines. This is a short term activity with a target duration of 30 days. July 25th is when GoldBank SLG IT  would like to show case the mockups/templates to business. We can have Parag and Partha develop the mockups offshore on DataTech infrastructure and have one of them travel onshore in time (a week or so) for the Jul 25th timeline for deploying on GoldBank infrastructure and demonstrating to SLG IT and  business. This can be done at a fraction of the cost that you will otherwise spend with Qlikview professional services in this one month. I think the cost will be in the range of 10-15 K USD. If getting a SOW done at this stage will delay this initiative we can get started without a SOW. As we have an MSA and NDA in place there should be no issue sharing any data that needs to be used in the reports.



2.       Medium term: GoldBank desires to leverage an onshore/offshore model to provide build and support services around the Qlikview platform for meeting ongoing reporting needs in various lines of businesses. Parag will be the onshore Qlikview developer/lead and Partha will be offshore Qlikview developer. They will be available at standard MSA rates of 83 USD/hr and 25 USD/hr respectively. Additional offshore developers can be added or removed in a flexible staffing model. Again we will have the full support of the SMEs and leaders of the Qlikview COE to ensure the solutions delivered exceed business expectations.





Knowing this is a pilot run for DataTech and understanding the consequences of failure in this pilot, I am very confident that this recommendation is the best for SLG and will work as the foundation for building your trust in us and our credibility with SLG.



Sample reports are attached here. There are 4 sections in the deck. PLEASE VIEW THE DECK IN ‘SLIDE SHOW MODE’ AS SOME OF THE SLIDES HAVE ANIMATION.



1.       Credit risk and lending monitoring

2.       Transaction monitoring for an European regulator – Partha Patra had worked on this project

3.       Claims monitoring for an Insurance company - Partha Patra had worked on this project

4.       Profitability monitoring and internal reporting for DataTech – Parag Pingle had worked on this project.



I do have another profile but as discussed overall that is an inferior option to what we have recommended here. Please let me know if you have any questions or need to discuss.

Was reviewing this in preparation to send to client. We need to have a list of deliverables too and associated acceptance criteria. Please let me know what are the items you had planned to deliver as formal deliverables to the client.



In addition don’t we need to plan for some explicit PM time as now we have additional responsibilities from a project management perspective?

Subject: Qlikview POC model



Jagdish, Kunal,



Thanks for sharing your thoughts regarding QlikView POC today.



As discussed, following is a description of proposed model and information required:



Proposed model:

Alternative 1

1.       GoldBank team will send data in excel worksheets to DataTech team.

2.       DataTech team will develop dashboard / mockup using DataTech QlikView server.

3.       QVD file (dashboard) will be sent to GoldBank team through GoldBank email and will be copied on GoldBank server to view the dashboard

4.       In this model, time required for ID setup on GoldBank system will be saved



Alternative 2

1.       DataTech team will develop dashboards directly on GoldBank server



We recommend alternative 1 considering short ramp up time.



KM à I like alternative 1



Information required:



We need following information to get started on the POC:

1.       Can you please send us source data in excel / CSV format? Also, if there are any databases to be used, can you please send those in MS access format?

KMà I will provide data in excel spreadsheet soon (within a day). If there are databases to be used, I will provide data in Excel or MS Access format

2.       What is the total number of dashboards that we are targeting to develop in this POC?

KM à Hard to know at this time but there by be 25-30 components

3.       What is the profile of users who will be accessing the dashboards?

KM à Senior management team

4.       Can you please share some existing reports / dashboards so that we can get an idea of information needs to users.

KMà Please see attached documents for examples of KPI, reports and dashboards

5.       We have data from Lendmark and Sheffield available in CCRM datamart which has been developed by DataTech. Sample data is enclosed herewith. Can you please check if we can use this data? This data is for loans in these 2 LOBs

KMà Don’t think we are focusing just on Lendmark/Sheffield at this time. We will be covering the lending and marketing group as a whole

6.       Can we have weekly webex demos of dashboard with the business users?

KMà Yes

7.       What is the version of QlikView on GoldBank server?

KMà Version 9, Build 5. We have both Server and publisher on the same hardware



As discussed, if you can send us sample data in excel, we can get started on mock up creation.



Thanks,

Madhu,

I spoke to Mark.  There is no need for a telephone meeting today.

Mark is going to put his thoughts on paper of what he views his needs are in terms of mock up etc.  He is also working to get financial data from Cognos system today.  He is to forward all this by end of day today our time.  I will forward this to entire team. 

Mark would like to go over his notes / charts etc. (which I will forward later today) during our 8:30AM call tomorrow (already scheduled by Kunal).

If you can make sure both Parag and Partha both are onsite absolutely positively Monday morning for a 9AM meeting with him, that would be great.  I will forward details of convenient near by hotel etc. to you later on today.

Madhu, Deena,



I talked to Santosh just now to check availability of Suresh Gopalakrishnan (who can play role of very strong BA as well developer on QlikView). But unfortunately he is not available.



But Santosh can come to Madison for 3 days (1 day for requirement gathering, 1 day for intermediate review and 1 day on 25th July for final presentation) and he also agreed to do reviews from business perspective every alternate day. He won’t bill on project, but we just have to take care of his travel.



Let me know if your thoughts on this.

Just now talked to Parag. He is buying a house and his deal is to be signed on 20th. Seller of the house is travelling from outside India for 2 days so it can’t be postponed.

So he can not travel.



To expedite the process of delivering on 25th, we can commit that both Parag and I will travel during US day time.



I can try for a B1 visa and be there on 16th. But traveling on B1 is difficult as DataTech immigration policies do not recommend this.



One more option is to have Mahesh Kale travel for Production support and Atul work with Partha for next 3 weeks and then move directly to Phase III.

Madhu, Deena,



I talked to Santosh just now to check availability of Suresh Gopalakrishnan (who can play role of very strong BA as well developer on QlikView). But unfortunately he is not available.



But Santosh can come to Madison for 3 days (1 day for requirement gathering, 1 day for intermediate review and 1 day on 25th July for final presentation) and he also agreed to do reviews from business perspective every alternate day. He won’t bill on project, but we just have to take care of his travel.



Let me know if your thoughts on this.



Thanks,

Just now talked to Parag. He is buying a house and his deal is to be signed on 20th. Seller of the house is travelling from outside India for 2 days so it can’t be postponed.

So he can not travel.



To expedite the process of delivering on 25th, we can commit that both Parag and I will travel during US day time.



I can try for a B1 visa and be there on 16th. But traveling on B1 is difficult as DataTech immigration policies do not recommend this.



One more option is to have Mahesh Kale travel for Production support and Atul work with Partha for next 3 weeks and then move directly to Phase III.

Imp one here in the email. We have a meeting face to face with GoldBank senior mgrs on Monday. So it will be useful to have Santosh there on Monday.

Santosh,



FYI…. I will convey you travel dates for you by week end.



Madhu,



I also talked to Narendra Chincholikar who is a senior techie from BIM and currently with 21C account in US. He can work on this project part time. He is checking if he can travel to Madison for 3 weeks. Since he has already worked with Santosh, it might be a very good combination.

Thanks Jagdish for the documents.



Few initial questions:



1.       What is ‘Call model’ and ‘Call activity model’?

Call model is established for RAC to define number of activities based on the client classification. Call Activity Model is the activity report

2.       Can we get sample data for the reports?

Yes. We have the data for you.

3.       For report 3 (report for 44 sales people), has the scorecard been developed?

As you heard Mark, the score card is the behavioral summary for the system adoption as a whole. We should have clearly defined next week

4.       In the financials dashboard, in ‘Outstanding’ tab, what does EDP represent?

It is EOP = End of Period (last day of month)

5.       Do we have values of RAROC & ROA available?

Yes.

Thanks,

I saw Santosh Kamat in the Atlanta Office today, and he is strongly recommending that the Mondays meeting with GoldBank business representatives should be moved to Tuesday.

Santosh feels that he needs to participate by phone, because he is sincerely concerned about our Qlikview technical resources participating in this meeting with GoldBanks Business.



Per Santoshs request, can you move Mondays meeting to Tuesday?

So far it has been the most visually appealing dashboard I have seen (and I have seen a lot of them). QlickView may not have the same look and feel but some of the principles on aesthetics are important:



1.       Use thin lines instead of thick. They should ideally be grey so that they do not interfere with the content presented.

2.       All numbers and txt should have a clean look. So font size , type and color selection is important. Lets have a page of options and we can then select which one works best for us.

3.       Use colors which are not contrasting. Stick to a set of standard colors. (not sure I know which ones. But lets look at the FirstBank Dashboard and stick to the color scheme they have used)

4.       The look should be CLEAN. This means there is white space and all unnecessary lines / text / colors are omitted.

5.       The front page should have a table which provides overall picture (historical, current, budgeted) and also clear drill downs. Bankers like to look at numbers first and then the visuals.

6.       DO NOT use dials etc. unless they add value. Remember we are not doing a tool demo but are drawing a picture for management. Desktop space is valuable so we need to use it wisely



My recommendations are as follows:

1.       DO NOT start building the dashboard in Qlickview. Draw it in Visio or ppt. we will get bogged down in coding instead focusing on visual appeal.

2.       Get a list of data elements and divide them into

a.       Dimension related (to define drill paths)

b.      KPI (derived) vs. base elements

c.       Historical, current, budgeted

d.      Information vs. decision variables

3.        Once we have these elements lets have a brain storming session on:

a.       What should the first page have

b.      How we should present the information

c.       What are the drill paths and how do we accommodate the drill pages

d.      What graphics can improve the presentation or make the information compact to present

e.      How do we accommodate the graphics in the pages

4.       Start building the Dashboard



Let me know if this approach helps you.

We had a meeting with Brains team today. Following is description of scope:



Scope is 1 summary tab and 3 detail LOB wise tabs to be delivered by 25th. GoldBank has already identified KPIs and KPI identification is not required.



Enclosed are 2 documents:

1.       Discussion.pdf  Refer page number 3 of this document. This contains layout of summary tab as proposed by business.

2.       QV examples.ppt  This document contain sample dashboard developed by QlikView consulting for GoldBank.  



Mark today clearly said that this project is about designing visually appealing dashboards.



They will be giving us mock data on next Tuesday.

We have started work on creating dashboard using mock data. I will send first draft tomorrow.



Thanks,

	Client informed yesterday that they are more interested in visuals. There are little or no drill paths. Just 1 dimension I.e. LOB.
	So we might have to focus more on qlikview. But your suggestions @ how to make it clean are great. We will implement them.
	For summary tab they have even given the layout. We will propose alternate with just tables as u suggest.

	We had a meeting with Brain’s team today. Following is description of scope:



	Scope is 1 summary tab and 3 detail LOB wise tabs to be delivered by 25th. GoldBank has already identified KPIs and KPI identification is not required.



	Enclosed are 2 documents:

	1.������ Discussion.pdf – Refer page number 3 of this document. This contains layout of summary tab as proposed by business.

	2.������ QV examples.ppt – This document contain sample dashboard developed by QlikView consulting for GoldBank. �



	Mark today clearly said that this project is about designing visually appealing dashboards.



	They will be giving us mock data on next Tuesday.

	We have started work on creating dashboard using mock data. I will send first draft tomorrow.



	Thanks,

By when I can get access to Version 9.0., once I have version 9.0 install we can use the Global Search, Trellis charts.



Partha/Parag:-



Few observation:

a.       I am not sure what is the difference in Net Income & Quality Chart on Dash board?

b.      Outstanding & Production charts Y axis is in Millions or Billions?

c.       There is no chart like a PIE chart based on either LOB or Product wise Revenue/Outstanding amount



I would need inputs from you to understand the data so that we can represent in better way.



I am sure that we can create Water Fall chart on the Dashboard like below, since you have better understanding of data lets try to come up a scenario (This is not there in the PDF) however we give this as a add on to them to show our creativity.



Use below link to understand more abt Water fall charts  which we can try to implement in our QV Dashboard.

Amit,



We have started work on GoldBank project.



Basically scope is 1 summary tab and 3 detail LOB wise tabs to be delivered by 25th.



Enclosed are 2 documents:

1.       Discussion.pdf  Refer page number 3 of this document. This contains layout of summary tab as proposed by business.

2.       QV examples.ppt  This document contain sample dashboard developed by QlikView consulting for GoldBank. This will give you an idea about colors used by GoldBank.



Client today clearly said that this project is about designing VISUALLLY APPEALING DASHBOARDs.



Enclosed is QVD file prepared by us.



Can you please spend an hour or so and beautify this? You are free to change appearance. So if you want to change line graph to bar, change it. If you have multiple suggestions, create option-1, option-2 etc.



We will have to keep on doing this exercise every day till next week end.



Thanks,

I do not think HR will approve our request and also not sure if Partha will also agree to it. The only option is to delay his travel till this month end and till then he should be working from offshore.

We have an associate in GoldBank account traveling to US tomorrow.



He has L1 visa and also has SSN and will be billable in US. Can his travel be on STV?

Since billing rate is $25, we would prefer this to be STV.



Please let us know ASAP.

Please see if you can use the FirstBank grid. So far it has been the most visually appealing dashboard I have seen (and I have seen a lot of them). QlickView may not have the same look and feel but some of the principles on aesthetics are important:



1.       Use thin lines instead of thick. They should ideally be grey so that they do not interfere with the content presented.

2.       All numbers and txt should have a clean look. So font size , type and color selection is important. Lets have a page of options and we can then select which one works best for us.

3.       Use colors which are not contrasting. Stick to a set of standard colors. (not sure I know which ones. But lets look at the FirstBank Dashboard and stick to the color scheme they have used)

4.       The look should be “CLEAN”. This means there is “white space” and all unnecessary lines / text / colors are omitted.

5.       The front page should have a table which provides overall picture (historical, current, budgeted) and also clear drill downs. Bankers like to look at numbers first and then the visuals.

6.       DO NOT use dials etc. unless they add value. Remember we are not doing a tool demo but are drawing a picture for management. Desktop space is valuable so we need to use it wisely



My recommendations are as follows:

1.       DO NOT start building the dashboard in Qlickview. Draw it in Visio or ppt. we will get bogged down in coding instead focusing on visual appeal.

2.       Get a list of data elements and divide them into

a.       Dimension related (to define drill paths)

b.      KPI (derived) vs. base elements

c.       Historical, current, budgeted

d.      Information vs. decision variables

3.        Once we have these elements lets have a brain storming session on:

a.       What should the first page have

b.      How we should present the information

c.       What are the drill paths and how do we accommodate the drill pages

d.      What graphics can improve the presentation or make the information compact to present

e.      How do we accommodate the graphics in the pages

4.       Start building the Dashboard



Let me know if this approach helps you.

Subject: GoldBank QlikView project task



Santosh, Narendra,



We had a meeting with Brain’s team today. Following is description of scope:



Scope is 1 summary tab and 3 detail LOB wise tabs to be delivered by 25th. GoldBank has already identified KPIs and KPI identification is not required.



Enclosed are 2 documents:

1.       Discussion.pdf – Refer page number 3 of this document. This contains layout of summary tab as proposed by business.

2.       QV examples.ppt – This document contain sample dashboard developed by QlikView consulting for GoldBank.  



Mark today clearly said that this project is about designing visually appealing dashboards.



They will be giving us mock data on next Tuesday.

We have started work on creating dashboard using mock data. I will send first draft tomorrow.



Thanks,

	I liked this idea and if we really need this buttons for a single chart and not for others then this is the direction we should head.
	Now the other idea where I changed the data (normalised the 60 rows into 180 rows) will make all the charts filtered as YTD/MTD...
Anyways lets decide on that...and do a small round of data validation to see if the results are coming correct.
In the meanwhile,  I m still copying data..:) should be done in some time!!!

So for the Relationship Manager/ Credit Manager role, one log-in per week is an absolute minimum. As we gain more comfort and familiarity with the system, I would expect to see a minimum of 2-3 log-ins per week for this user group.



For Branch Managers we’ve (very recently) trained them to review certain reports on a weekly basis to uncover coaching opportunities and monitor dealer trends. One log-in per week should be a good minimum for that role.



Also, the Delinquent Activity report was one of the original SF.com reports that has proven valuable so I see that as a pretty good measure of adherence at this point.

Actually we have not executed 14 & 15. 11 was  CCRM phase 2 after which we executed two more with a different numbering system. I and gene thought we will leave 12 & 13 for those two and start from 14. So FMER was supposed to be 14, Insurance online channel refresh 15 and the Qlikview 16. But this is okay. We can go sequential from now on.



We just need to remember that there are only two SOWs after 11 to account for the numbers 12-15.

                Sorry for delay  in response. I was on leave.



Comments inline



1. In the net income chart (where we have drill down), it shows level (i.e.QTD/MTD/YTD) near the axis. Can we get rid of that. It does not look good. I still ned the drill button with arrow.

Amit:- Its a data issue, we need to map the date Dimension with the Year/Quarter/Month/day. As we have added a calculated dimension on the chart n second one is Cylic drill, which is causing this issue.



2. There is a very trivial problem. In case of charge off and few other measures, client has given us values that should appear if no LOB is selected. For example, charge for each of the 12 LOBs is 2, but when no selection is made, total charge off is not 2x12=24, but it is still about 2. Client has given this resulting value directly. How do we incorporate this?

Amit:-  Where all we have this issue, I need more inputs on this , with above it looks we have a high level value n we need to drill into.



3. On the Net Income chart (with drill), it is showing chart as stacked even though I want separate bars for planned and actual. Can you tell me how to remove this?

 Amit:- Work around would be using a Symbols for second Bar. In Combo chart you cannot change the chart type from Group to Stacked & vice versa.








4. We are going to show this initial version to client tomorrow. From a presentation perspective, can you please spend some time? All charts with bars are not looking good. Can you use some best practices?

 Amit:-  I have sent one updated file last week with different GUI design. Reattaching the same.



One more important thing, we are creating Synthetic key in the Data model. With Synthetic key I mean across all the tables we have LOB & Data column which is common.  Our approach should

a.  Create a Composite key in each and every table like  Date & | & LOB  as Key  and use this new key to connect all the tables. Remember to rename the Date * LOB column  across all tables  or

b.  Link all the tables on Date Key only.

c. We can have a bridge table to store all common dimension and then link the file.



I am getting error while opening the file financial3.xls.  Please resend.

Parag, Amit,



Here is the latest mail. I could implement drill down for Net Income. Enclosed is latest QVD.



We need to urgently work on:



Parag:

1. I am enclosing latest QVD & reformatted Excel source. In this excel, production data is missing. Can you add that and create production chart?



2. For outstandings, can you create a separate tab in excel, import that and create drill down similar to net income



3. Please test few values in each graph and make sure that it is not summing up anywhere.



Amit,



Thanks a lot for explaining drill down. Your timely help solved that proble. We now have following problems (and this list will keep on growing):

1. In the net income chart (where we have drill down), it shows level (i.e.QTD/MTD/YTD) near the axis. Can we get rid of that. It does not look good. I still ned the drill button with arrow.

Since we have first review with client tomorrow, we need to get this done by sunday afternoon US time / Sunday EOD India time. Soliciting your help!

1)      Dealer Activity Against Call Model

3)      User adoption (We will use login history. I will send out that file, we already have list of users)

4)      Loan applications (monthly quota vs. actual)

5)      Loan Quality (we will use the average risk grade for each rep, branch, region and company as a whole. I just discussed this metric with Todd McArthur at RAC and seems like a low-hanging fruit that is important to them. I will send out data and details under separate email).



These are the 5 KPIs for RAC. Mark/Tina, please provide your feedback.

I just sent you guys 3 emails each containing RAC’s loan app data. I have added Risk Grade as a column there. We will use that in conjunction with the Application Status column to develop a KPI for loan quality.



Per Todd McArthur, RAC tracks the loan quality at the rep, branch, region and company level by assigning the associated risk grade a numerical score. We will only work with the booked loan applications (Application Status = DONE/COMPLETE/BOOKED).



Basically, the idea is to calculate average grade at each level (repàbranchàregionàcompany) as follows:



    A1          .40 (best)

    A2          .55

    A3          .70

    A4          .85

    B1          1.00 (worse, you will find few if any loan apps with this grade and below)

    B2         1.20

    C           1.50



We can then use this to plot rep’s grade against branch, region, company or compare region against region etc.



Mark, any thoughts or questions?

Revised financial data to include the actual & plan data for 'past dues' and 'non-accruals'.  Also added (need to discuss usage) is 'Growth Avg O/S' actual and plan data. Still missing June income and expense data; should be able to incorporate tomorrow depending on availability.

Kunal - please distribute the data as necessary.

Mark/Tina - we still need to discuss potentially including plan data for the ratios (RAROC, ROA, Efficiency and Yield); availability of the data I would pull from is not consistent and easily attainable.

Let me know if you have any questions.

The goals are per branch which we can easily translate down to individual reps. They have ranges and so if QlikView can’t do range then we would simply go for the high end.



Obviously, quality alone is not sufficient if that makes a branch not attain their volume target so it would be interesting to plot this against their quota.



Let me know if we can use this as a metric. If not, then we can look at “focus groups”.

Please see the attached files containing completed activities for prospects and dealer assignments by reps, class and branch. The second file contains a new column called “Focus Group”.



Per my communication with Mark and Partha/kishor in last couple days, here are the revised KPIs for RAC:



1.       Dealer activities against goal

a.       Goal: Refer to CallActivityModel.xls for the formula that will be calculate the goal. The goal for each user who is assigned dealers is,  “A” dealer count OR ”C” dealer count * 1 + “B” dealer count * 1.5 + “D” dealer count * 0.5

                                                               i.      So if a rep has 100 dealers with 10 A, 35 B, 30 C, 25 D then the goal is going to be : (10+30)*1+35*1.5+25*0.5 = 105 activities

                                                             ii.      The cap for number of dealer activities a rep can do in a month is 168 (21 days * 8 activities a day) so that is the high end of the goal regardless of how many dealers a rep is assigned

                                                            iii.      You may be able to calculate this for each person from the dealer assigned by rep file and store it in the RAC_Users.csv if you can’t calculate this dynamically

b.      Goal for branch and region is simply sum of the individual user’s goal

2.       Prospect activities against goal

a.       Goal: (168-dealer goal  activities per month)/number of prospects assigned for every  active user who is assigned any prospects (refer to Prospects assigned per user.xls). This number also cannot exceed 168

b.      Goal for branch and region is simply sum of the individual user’s goal

3.       Loan applications quota vs. actual

a.       Goal: Compare monthly volume for booked loan applications (status =DONE/BOOKED/COMPLETED) against individual’s quota. Also plot dealer class on the graph

b.      Goal for branch and region is also provided

4.       User adoption/adherence

a.       Goal: 75% adoption/adherence

                                                              i.      Adoption: 75% of users must be logging in once a week (use the RAC_Users.csv to see last login dates). I have also provided login history (RAC_SixMonths_LoginHistory.csv) if we want to measure who is logging in the most/least. We must keep the date of the data pull in mind when plotting this data

                                                             ii.      Adherence: 75% of all dealers must be have dealer class value non-blank and dealers are classified according to the distribution provided by management (10% A, 35% B, 30% C, 25% D) at rep, branch, region and company level. The dealer classification is what drives activities assigned to reps

5.       Focus group performance against non-focus group

a.       Goal: 5% more activities for focus group dealers compared to non-focus group dealers. 1% growth in booked loan volume compared to benchmark period.

b.      I will work to get you loan application data for the benchmark period and for the focus group contest period



Mark, I have revised the last KPI to reflect focus group instead of average loan risk grade as per your suggestion. Please let me know if the KPI/goal description above meets our requirements for the first set of deliverables.

GoldBank Virtual Desktop Infrastructure resources have been provisioned for your staff.  Please ensure the attached document explaining how to utilize the tool is accessible to them and the following instructions are understood.

Data Storage Guidelines:
All GoldBank users are provisioned a personal file share mapped to drive H:.  Upon first use of a Virtual Workstation, it is required that the user validate that drive H: exists.  If there is no drive H:, the user should contact their GoldBank manager who should email ‘Offshore Request’.

GoldBank Virtual workstations should not have any data stored on them, all data should reside on the network including user and email files.  Each user should use either their H: drive, or a departmental share as directed by your manager.  When the state of the workstation becomes degraded, a new workstation will be provisioned and all data on the corrupt workstation will be lost.

Help Desk Requests:
If assistance is needed, please contact the GoldBank Network Control Help Desk at 1-866-567-4357.  All users to provide the following information when submitting a ticket.

	+ Name:

Subject: RAC KPI Goals and Actual Definitions



Just reiterating below the actual and goals definitions for the RAC KPIs:



For each of the KPIs, the following must work correctly:

1)      Filter by year, quarter, month

2)      Filter by sales rep, branch and region


Dealer Activities



Goal: Min (168, (A dealers + C dealers)*1+B dealers*1.5+D dealers*0.5) (where dealer refers to dealers assigned)

Actual: Number of completed dealer activities



Prospect Activities

Goal: Min((168 – Dealer Activities Goal from Above), # of prospects assigned) (The dealer activity goal is in italics above)

Actual: Number of completed prospect activities



User Adoption

Goal: 75% user adoption 75% of users must be logging in every week (for single user it is 100% or 0%)

Actual: User(s) logged in last 1-week (may want to hard-code the 1-week by looking at the date of file)



User Adherence

Goal: Number of dealers assigned classified as follows:

                10 % A

                35% B

                30% C

                25% B D

Actual:  Actual classification of dealers assigned



Quota vs. Actual

Goal:  Quota assigned by user/branch/region

Actual: Sum of amount financed



Loan Quality (*I am working on this one*)         

Goal: Loan grade per the assignments (for users within branch, their loan grade assignment is same as branches. For region it is average of branches under it)

Actual: Average loan grade of booked loans



OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EACH KPI COMPONENT IS SHOWING DATA CORRECTLY. I PLAN TO GET MARK’S FEEDBACK ON MONDAY.

The Filter & the Goal problem in RAC KPI is resolved now.
This is partially happening because of the source data.

e.g. There is a user called Angel Rarick present in Assigned_Dlrs_with_Rep_Class.xls but same is not present in Prospect Activity
Similary one more user Augustine Csejtey present in Assigned_Dlrs_with_Rep_Class.xls but same is not present in Prospect Activity.

We should suggest a joint workshop for 2-3 days. We can have Santosh and couple of people from our technical team. With our knowledge of data and Santoshs reporting framework, we can create reporting on the fly during the workshop.

We can take case of QlikView POC where we created dashboards during discussions.



Microstrategy and QlikView can be used for reporting. I know Mike is SAS savy so SAS can be an alternative.



We can include a day on demonstrating how the CCRM can support advanced analytics (stress testing etc).

I spoke to Mike OBrien today and found out that the CCRM initiative is stalled because Barbra feels that we are still just putting in data in it and not getting any reports out.



Mike Stevens is putting together a team of people from his group ( Not Brad) and some resources from Susans group to come up with the reporting requirements. Is there some way for us to suggest a joint workshop or is there any way you can plug in to help them move this forward faster.

The CCRM booking is extremely critical for us and also I am afraid if this is not started up again the project will die down like other things at GoldBank.



We are meeting Mike Stevens on July 30th. If you are available we can jointly pitch it to him.



Let me know your thoughts.

We sat together and discussed the technical documents and we have come up with few queries as below.

Please find the queries as below w.r.t Change Data Capture document:-
1) Informatica mapping using Powerexchange.
2) DMexpress.
3) REX utility.
4) Control total fields in the file.
5) In 'Delete case' why do we close the record with effective_date + 1,
   as against in 'change case' we close the record by using 'effective_date - 1'
6) As per the design provided for informatica mapping for loading into the hub table,
   the design involves 2 pipelines,2 filters etc , instead can we merge these 2 pipelines
   and use a router transformation instead of 2 filters.
7) In the validation process as per the CDC document, we need to compare the 'HUB table' and
   the 'CDC flat file', but as per the low level architecture document,
   we need to compare the 'original data file' and 'HUB table' which seems to be correct.
   Please confirm which case is correct.
Please find the queries as below w.r.t low level architecture:-
1) What's the use of the view tablename_CRNT

Rohan,

Please find attached the cobol copy book. You can look into the other MICM mappings for your reference present in the below mentioned link.

The target table strucutre would contain the following columns:
SRC_STMT_CD

MIM_2015KINST
MIM_2015KREC
MIM_2015KINDEX

MIM_2015SOURCEDESC



Use the same logic as used in the other MICM mapping docs. Please match the cobol source datatype to the target column datatype.

Let me know in case of any concerns.

Hi Yogesh,

Peggy wanted the tester to start from Monday. She walked to my desk today to say that she doesn't want this project to jeopardize other project. She wants an immediate replacement for Renuka. I guess we should set up a replacement today itself for Production support. I feel that we should avoid having another interview for a tester in FMER. It would be rather easy to find a replacement for Renuka in production support since there is no interview for that role. Let me know your thoughts.

Subject: New mapping document for MICM



Rohan,

Please find attached the cobol copy book. You can look into the other MICM mappings for your reference present in the below mentioned link.

<http://org.sp.Gbanknet.com/sites/ADSDAT/Financial%20Management%20External%20Repoting%20FMER/Forms/Work.aspx?RootFolder=%2fsites%2fADSDAT%2fFinancial%20Management%20External%20Repoting%20FMER%2fRelease%20I%20%2d%20Deposits%2fArchitecture%5fDesign%2fLL%20Design%2fMap%20Docs%2fSrc%20to%20HUB%2fMICM&FolderCTID=&View=%7bE1ED9F3D%2d469E%2d4E06%2d89CB%2dD797F3C364CB%7d>http://org.sp.Gbanknet.com/sites/ADSDAT/Financial%20Management%20External%20Repoting%20FMER/Forms/Work.aspx?RootFolder=%2fsites%2fADSDAT%2fFinancial%20Management%20External%20Repoting%20FMER%2fRelease%20I%20%2d%20Deposits%2fArchitecture%5fDesign%2fLL%20Design%2fMap%20Docs%2fSrc%20to%20HUB%2fMICM&FolderCTID=&View=%7bE1ED9F3D%2d469E%2d4E06%2d89CB%2dD797F3C364CB%7d



The target table strucutre would contain the following columns:
SRC_STMT_CD
EFF_FROM_DT
EFF_TO_DT
MIM_2015KINST
MIM_2015KREC
MIM_2015KINDEX
MIM_2015KEFFDT
MIM_2015_UPD_DATE
MIM_2015_UPD_TIME
MIM_2015_UPD_USER
MIM_2015_UPD_ORG
MIM_2015INDEXRATE
MIM_2015INDMNTDATE
MIM_2015LONGDESC
MIM_2015SHORTDESC
MIM_2015SOURCEDESC



Use the same logic as used in the other MICM mapping docs. Please match the cobol source datatype to the target column datatype.

Let me know in case of any concerns.

Anand

Foe slide 4 you have two options. It is quite complex and dense if we put everything. We can split this into 2/3 slides. Ie 1 slide covering composition. Second covering risk and profitability and the third covering Credit quality and assessment. For each of these categories we should have a slide which has a sample report (excel) .



The assessment is as follows:

1.       Empty circle: no data

2.       Quarter circle filled: 25 % data

3.       And so on

Again, this is by LOB so this may become a bit intense to do.

Here is how client reporting would work from now.

1) Project Status Report.
Onsite counterpart would create detailed project status report based on all tasks and send it to Project leads in GoldBank every Friday.

2) Engagement Report.
Engagement Level Report including, Billing, Budget, Requisitions status, Active project status risks and mitigations will be published on Tuesday.
Offshore project Manager will create this and Onsite Project Manager will send it to Client after review.

Here are actions required on this engagement level Status report.

- Could you please have August billing section filled out.
- Qlikview needs to be taken out of this from SDS delivery to avoid confusion.
- We need to add budget consumption status (this is relevant to Production support, Previous months numbers are available in attached document.

Ive been swapping emails with Brad and we had a lengthy conversation on Friday which I will share.   Keep in mind that some of this has gone through several persons before getting to you.   Here are the key points.



1)      The best news.   They will deliver a pile of reports based on the database to Barbara this week.  Craig (Brad database, Craig reporting) and his team of eight have been working on these for several weeks now.   Brad feels good about what is about to  be delivered and they are still working on more.   He (and the team) is comfortable with using the database. 

2)      Brad says the Mike Stevens is spreading mis-information.   One example he gave was that Mike Stevens had convinced Barbara that MicroStrategy was a requirement for doing reports against the database.   Brad had to sell her otherwise.  

3)      Speaking of Microstrategy, none of the reports pending delivery this week were developed with Microstrategy.   Brad seems to have abandoned that group.   Not seeking IT help at all for report development.

4)      He also is not seeking any IT help for phase 3 back end anymore.   He is of a do it yourself mindset now.   He does not have faith in them

5)      Mike OBrien is now more present.   With this an above, Brad says that IT / CCRM relationship is very bad now.   He speculated that it could be as bad as it was more than two years ago.   He said that he had not talked to Susan in about six weeks. 

6)      It seems that IT submitted a bid for phase 3 also.   $2.5 mill.  

7)

Please see attached architecture documents for couple of application.

HUB is source data layer in Gbank BI environment. Data from all line of businesses is captured and stored in udb (On AIX). This is collectively called as HUB. This layer captures data from several other interfaces like unix, mainframe etc.

Most of the effort so far had gone into building this layer along with IBM bdw model on top of this.

All other mart project as rule of thumb uses this layer as a source and built on top of it. I have included CCRM as one of such applications which uses HUB data.

In some cases if we need some more time to finalize and suggest the name, it will be great if you can get a sample profile for every position by this Friday. ( I understand that person might be working on some other account and might not be releasable).



We really do not want to oversell/under sell any profile as client might want to interview them and we do not want to set any wrong expectations in the beginning itself. It is also important to submit sample profiles to take some advantage against competition.



Regards,

Yogesh

Subject: FW: GoldBank Proposal - need resource names.
Importance: High



We have received a RFP from GoldBank for CCRM phase 3 project. This proposal overall needs 41 resources out of this 12 are  TDI.



We need to propose resources for this proposal. We have fairly good chance (50% at this point) of winning this. So we need to identify good resources to increase our chances.  Following are the details of resource requirements for TDI.



We really do not want to oversell/under sell any profile as client might want to interview them and we do not want to set any wrong expectations in the beginning itself. It is also important to submit sample profiles to take some advantage against competition. Can we get sample profiles by Thursday.

We are getting Narendra released from Assurant so he can replace kishor and also the new manager (is on target to join us for Gbank project in Feb). I had a long discussion with Assurant team and they are ready to release Narendra in next 3 to 4 weeks. We already have given a replacement for Narendra to Assurant and Dilip (Assurant Manager) has initiated the process of onboarding  Narendra’s replacement.



This should take care of the issue.



kishor, you can start transitioning to Narendrs and apply his Gbank ID. While is Gbank Id is in process he needs to be working on Assurant (for next few weeks he needs to step on two stone not letting any one down and we should be good.)

Deena/Arul,



Need your help to sort of Narendra Chincholikar’s� release issue for GoldBank (as replacement for kishor). I have not heard anything from Virendra but below are his two managers. Peter sits in Rosemont. I think if they agree he can be released immediately. ( As per my discussion with Narendra and others , his backfill has already joined at onsite and even backfill at offshore is on boarded). So I guess if Pete/Dilip make a call, it will be done immediately.



If you have any connections with them it might help.

Arul and Yogesh,



We are getting Narendra released from Assurant so he can replace kishor and also the new manager (is on target to join us for Gbank project in Feb). I had a long discussion with Assurant team and they are ready to release Narendra in next 3 to 4 weeks. We already have given a replacement for Narendra to Assurant and Dilip (Assurant Manager) has initiated the process of onboarding �Narendra’s replacement.



This should take care of the issue.



kishor, you can start transitioning to Narendrs and apply his Gbank ID. While is Gbank Id is in process he needs to be working on Assurant (for next few weeks he needs to step on two stone not letting any one down and we should be good.)



Thanks,

4. !4th Feb is  deposit load date, keeping some buffer kishor would be available for any support for 2 weeks after 18th Feb.

Subject: GoldBank RFP



Sam, Kishore



GoldBank intends to put up for bidding all of their outsourced work. The work will be grouped into COEs based on service (testing) or technology (Pega, .Net. Data warehousing etc). The total value of all positions is expected to be in the range of 30 M USD/year. GoldBank expects to see strong differentiation in terms of capability and/or pricing to choose a vendor who is already not an incumbent in that area. While we are an incumbent for BIM, FMER and some issues on ERM have negated the incumbent advantage to some extent. To make up we will have to demonstrate strong capability/pricing value. For BIM COE, we will compete against CTS (in Susans area) and TCS (in Brian Houses area). I have some sizing data from late 2010, attached. The RFP may bump up the size in some areas but this info is expected to be pretty much in the ball park.



We have a bidders conference on Monday, April 25th, 5-6 pm eastern time. I will send you the invite. Can you please depute someone to be the BIM point contact to attend the bidders conference and own the preparation of the RFP response?
